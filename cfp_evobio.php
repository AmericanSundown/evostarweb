Join us in Amsterdam  for Evo<span class="red">BIO</span>, a multidisciplinary track that brings together researchers working in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
 that apply advanced techniques coming from Evolutionary Computation, Machine Learning, and Data Mining to address important problems in biology, from the molecular and genomic dimension, to the individual and population level.  Evo<span class="red">BIO</span> engages researchers who are developing or applying advanced artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms to cutting edge problems in bioinformatics and computational biology.  Each accepted paper will be presented orally or as a poster at the conference and will be printed in the proceedings published by <strong>Springer Verlag</strong> in the <strong>LNCS</strong> series.  Possible topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Interpreting genomic or metagenomic data</li>
<li>Discovering regulatory or expression pathways</li>
<li>Rational drug design and personalized medicine</li>
<li>Modeling ecosystems or population dynamics</li>
<li>Discovering genome-disease or genome-phenotype associations</li>
<li>Biomedical text/data mining and visualization</li>
<li>Network biology/medicine</li>
<li>Omics data analysis and functional genomics for complex diseases</li>
<li>Gene-gene interactions and gene-environment interactions for disease association analysis</li>
<li>Protein Structure Prediction</li>
<li>Assembling next generation sequence data</li>
</ul>
