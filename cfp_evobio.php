<h2>The European Conference on Evolutionary Computation, Machine Learning and Data Mining in Computational Biology</h2>

Join us in Copenhagen for Evo<span class="red">BIO</span>, a multidisciplinary conference that brings together researchers working in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology that apply advanced techniques coming from Evolutionary Computation, Machine Learning, and Data Mining to address important problems in biology, from the molecular and genomic dimension, to the individual and population level. Evo<span class="red">BIO</span> engages researchers who are developing or applying advanced artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms to cutting edge problems in bioinformatics and computational biology. Each accepted paper will be presented orally or as a poster at the conference and will be printed in the proceedings published by Springer Verlag in the LNCS series.  Possible topics of interest include:

<ul>
<li>Interpretating genomic or metagenomic data</li>
<li>Discovering regulatory or expression pathways</li>
<li>Rational drug design and personalized medicine</li>
<li>Modeling ecosystems or population dynamics</li>
<li>Discovering genome-disease associations</li>
<li>Assembling next generation sequence data</li>
</ul>

Evo<span class="red">BIO</span> and other Evo<span class="red">STAR</span> conference have significant thematic overlap; often the work of one conference or application is of interest to attendees of another. Selected Evo<span class="red">BIO</span> papers may be considered for presentation in a joint session with other Evo<span class="red">STAR</span> conferences (Euro<span class="red">GP</span>, Evo<span class="red">COP</span>, and Evo<span class="red">MUSART</span>).

<h3>Submission Details</h3>

Evo<span class="red">BIO</span> is interested in papers in three article types:

<ul>
<li>Full research articles (maximum 12 pages) describing new methodologies, approaches, and/or applications (oral or poster presentation).
<li>Short reports (maximum 8 pages, poster presentation) describing new methodologies, approaches, and/or applications and System Demonstrations (maximum 8 pages) outlining the nature of the system and describe why the demonstration is likely to be of interest for the conference.
<li>Abstracts (maximum 4 pages) discussing work previously published in a journal: it is therefore essential that a reference to the previous article is clearly cited in the abstract (oral or poster presentation).
</ul>
Submissions must be original and not published elsewhere. They will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Submit your manuscript in Springer LNCS format.

The authors of accepted papers will have to improve their paper on the basis of the reviewers' comments and will be asked to send a camera ready version of their manuscripts. At least one author of each accepted work has to register for the conference, attend the conference and present the work.
