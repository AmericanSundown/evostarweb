<p><strong> Enhanced Multiobjective Population­Based Incremental Learning with

Applications in Risk Treaty Optimization

</strong><br/><em> Omar Andres Carmona Cortes, Andrew Rau­Chaplin

</em><br/> The purpose of this paper is to revisit the Multiobjective Population­Based

Incremental Learning method and show how its performance can be improved in the

context of a real­world financial optimization problem. The proposed enhancements

lead to both better performance and improvements in the quality of solutions. Its

performance was assessed in terms of runtime and speedup when parallelized. Also,

metrics such as the average number of solutions, the average hypervolume, and

coverage have been used in order to compare the Pareto frontiers obtained by both

the original and enhanced methods. Results indicated that the proposed method is

22.1% faster, present more solutions in the average (better defining the Pareto

frontier) and often generates solutions having larger hypervolumes. The enhanced

method achieves a speedup of 15.7 on 16 cores of a dual socket Intel multi­core

machine when solving a Reinsurance Contract Optimization problem involving 15

Layers or sub­contracts.

</p><p><strong> Genetic Programming with Memory for Financial Trading

</strong><br/><em> Alexandros Agapitos ,Anthony Brabazon, Michael O'Neill

</em><br/> A memory­enabled program representation in strongly­typed Genetic

Programming (GP) is compared against the standard representation in a number of

financial time­series modelling tasks. The paper first presents a survey of GP systems

that utilise memory. Thereafter, a number of simulations show that memory­enabled

programs generalise better than their standard counterparts in most datasets of this

problem domain.

</p><p><strong> Improving Fitness Functions in Genetic Programming for Classification on

Unbalanced Credit Card Data

</strong><br/><em> Van Loi Cao, Nhien­An Le­Khac, Michael O'Neill, Miguel Nicolau

James McDermott

</em><br/> Credit card classification based on machine learning has attracted

considerable interest from the research community. One of the most important tasks

in this area is the ability of classifiers to handle the imbalance in credit card data. In

this scenario, classifiers tend to yield poor accuracy on the minority class despite

realizing high overall accuracy. This is due to the influence of the majority class on

traditional training criteria. In this paper, we aim to apply genetic programming to

address this issue by adapting existing fitness functions. We examine two fitness

functions from previous studies and develop two new fitness functions to evolve GP

classifiers with superior accuracy on the minority class and overall. Two UCI credit

card datasets are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed fitness functions.

The results demonstrate that the proposed fitness functions augment GP classifiers,

encouraging fitter solutions on both the minority and the majority classes.

</p><p><strong> Evolving classification models for prediction of patient recruitment in multicentre

clinical trials using grammatical evolution

</strong><br/><em> Gilyana Borlikova, Michael Phillips, Louis Smith, Michael O'Neill

</em><br/> Successful and timely completion of prospective clinical trials depends on

patient recruitment as patients are critical to delivery of the prospective trial data.

There exists a pressing need to develop better tools/techniques to optimise patient

recruitment in multicentre clinical trials. In this study Grammatical Evolution (GE) is

used to evolve classification models to predict future patient enrolment performance of

investigators/site to be selected for the conduct of the trial. Prediction accuracy of the

evolved models is compared with results of a range of machine learning algorithms

widely used for classification. The results suggest that GE is able to successfully

induce classification models and analysis of these models can help in our

understanding of the factors providing advanced indication of a trial sites' future

performance.

</p><p><strong> Portfolio Optimization, a Decision­Support Methodology for Small Budgets

</strong><br/><em> Igor Deplano, Giovanni Squillero, Alberto Tonda

</em><br/> Several machine learning paradigms have been applied to financial

forecasting, attempting to predict the market's behavior, with the final objective of

profiting from trading shares. While anticipating the performance of such a complex

system is far from trivial, this issue becomes even harder when the investors do not

have large amounts of money available. In this paper, we present an evolutionary

portfolio optimizer for the management of small budgets. The expected returns are

modeled resorting to Multi­layer Perceptrons, trained on past market data, and the

portfolio composition is chosen by approximating the solution to a multi­objective

constrained problem. An investment simulator is then used to measure the portfolio

performance. The proposed approach is tested on real­world data from Milan stock

exchange, exploiting information from January 2000 to June 2010 to train the

framework, and data from July 2010 to August 2011 to validate it. The presented tool

is finally proven able to obtain a more than satisfying profit for the considered time

frame.

</p><p><strong> Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization for Portfolios in Emerging

Markets:Contrasting Higher Moments and Median Models

</strong><br/><em> Mai Ibrahim, Mohammed El­Beltagy, Motaz Khorshid

</em><br/> Multi­objective Evolutionary algorithms are well suited to Portfolio

Optimization and hence have been applied in complex situations were traditional

mathematical programming falls short. Often they were used in portfolios scenario of

classical Mean­Variance which are not applicable to the Emerging Markets. Emerging

Markets are characterized by return distributions that have shown to exhibit

significance departure from normality and are characterized by skewness and fat tails.

Therefore higher moments models and median models have been suggested in the

literature for asset allocation in this case. Three higher moment models namely the

Mean­Variance­Skewness, Mean­Variance­Skewness­Kurtosis, Mean­Variance-
Skewness­Kurtosis for return and liquidity and three median models namely the

Median­Value at Risk, Median­Conditional Value at Risk and Median­Mean Absolute

Deviation are formulated as a multi­objective problem and solved using a multi-
objective evolutionary algorithm namely the non­dominated sorting genetic algorithm II

.The six models are compared and tested on real financial data of the Egyptian Index

EGX. The median models were found in general to outperform the higher moments

models. The performance of the median models was found to be better as the out-
sample time increases.

</p><p><strong> On Combinatorial Optimisation in Analysis of Protein­Protein Interaction and

Protein Folding Networks

</strong><br/><em> David Chalupa

</em><br/> Protein­protein interaction networks and protein folding networks represent

prominent research topics at the intersection of bioinformatics and network science. In

this paper, we present a study of these networks from combinatorial optimisation point

of view. Using a combination of classical heuristics and stochastic optimisation

techniques, we were able to identify several interesting combinatorial properties of

biological networks of the COSIN project. We obtained optimal or near­optimal

solutions to maximum clique and chromatic number problems for these networks. We

also explore patterns of both non­overlapping and overlapping cliques in these

networks. Optimal or near­optimal solutions to partitioning of these networks into non-
overlapping cliques and to maximum independent set problem were discovered.

Maximal cliques are explored by enumerative techniques. Domination in these

networks is briefly studied, too. Applications and extensions of our findings are

discussed.

</p><p><strong> A Multi­objective Genetic Programming Biomarker Detection Approach in Mass

Spectrometry Data

</strong><br/><em> Soha Ahmed, Mengjie Zhang, Lifeng Peng, Bing Xue

</em><br/> Mass spectrometry is currently the most commonly used technology in

biochemical research for proteomic analysis. The main goal of proteomic profiling

using mass spectrometry is the classification of samples from different clinical states.

This requires the identification of proteins or peptides (biomarkers) that are expressed

differentially between different clinical states.

However, due to the high dimensionality of the data and the small number of samples,

classification of mass spectrometry data is a challenging task.

Therefore, an effective feature manipulation algorithm either through feature selection

or construction is needed to enhance the classification performance and at the same

time minimise the number of features. Most of the feature manipulation methods for

mass spectrometry data treat this problem as a single objective task which focuses on

improving the classification performance.

This paper presents two new methods for biomarker detection through multi­objective

feature selection and feature construction. The results show that the proposed multi-
objective feature selection method can obtain better subsets of features than the

single­objective algorithm and two traditional multi­objective approaches for feature

selection. Moreover, the multi­objective feature construction algorithm further

improves the perfomance over the multi­objective feature selection algorithm. This

paper is the first multi­objective genetic programming approach for biomarker

detection in mass spectrometry data.

</p><p><strong> Automating biomedical data science through tree­based pipeline optimization

</strong><br/><em> Randal Olson, Ryan Urbanowicz, Peter Andrews, Nicole Lavender, La Creis

Kidd, Jason Moore

</em><br/> Over the past decade, data science and machine learning has grown from a

mysterious art form to a staple tool across a variety of fields in academia, business,

and government. In this paper, we introduce the concept of tree­based pipeline

optimization for automating one of the most tedious parts of machine learning­­­

pipeline design. We implement a Tree­based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) and

demonstrate its effectiveness on a series of simulated and real­world genetic data

sets. In particular, we show that TPOT can build machine learning pipelines that

achieve competitive classification accuracy and discover novel pipeline operators­­­

such as synthetic feature constructors­­­that significantly improve classification

accuracy on these data sets. We also highlight the current challenges to pipeline

optimization, such as the tendency to produce pipelines that overfit the data, and

suggest future research paths to overcome these challenges. As such, this work

represents an early step toward fully automating machine learning pipeline design.

</p><p><strong> Bicliques in Graphs with Correlated Edges: From Artificial to Biological Networks

</strong><br/><em> Aaron Kershenbaum, Alicia Cutillo, Christian Darabos, Murray Keitha,

Schiaffino Robert, Jason H. Moore

</em><br/> Networks representing complex biological interactions are often very

intricate and rely on algorithmic tools for thorough quantitative analysis. In bi­layered

graphs, identifying subgraphs of potential biological meaning relies on identifying

bicliques between two sets of associated nodes, or variables ­­ for example, diseases

and genetic variants. Researchers have developed multiple approaches for forming

bicliques and it is important to understand the features of these models and their

applicability to real­life problems. We introduce a novel algorithm specifically designed

for finding maximal bicliques in large datasets. In this study, we applied this algorithm

to a variety of networks, including artificially generated networks as well as biological

networks based on phenotype­genotype and phenotype­pathway interactions. We

analyzed performance with respect to network features including density, node degree

distribution, and correlation between nodes, with density being the major contributor to

computational complexity. We also examined sample bicliques and postulate that

these bicliques could be useful in elucidating the genetic and biological underpinnings

of shared disease etiologies and in guiding hypothesis generation. Moving forward,

we propose additional features, such as weighted edges between nodes, that could

enhance our study of biological networks.

</p><p><strong> Hybrid biclustering algorithms for data mining

</strong><br/><em> Patryk Orzechowski, Krzysztof Boryczko

</em><br/> Hybrid methods are a branch of biclustering algorithms that emerge from

combining selected aspects of pre­existing approaches. The syncretic nature of their

construction enriches the existing methods providing them with new properties. In this

paper the concept of hybrid biclustering algorithms is explained. A representative

hybrid biclustering algorithm, inspired by neural networks and associative artificial

intelligence, is introduced and the results of its application to microarray data are

presented. Finally, the scope and application potential for hybrid biclustering

algorithms is discussed.

</p><p><strong> Discovering potential clinical profiles of Multiple Sclerosis from clinical and

pathological free text data with Constraint Non­negative Matrix Factorization

</strong><br/><em> Jacopo Acquarelli, Elena Marchiori, Monica Bianchini

</em><br/> Constrained non­negative matrix factorization (CNMF) is an effective

machine learning technique to cluster documents in the presence of class label

constraints. In this work, we provide a novel application of this technique in research

on neuro­degenerative diseases. Specifically, we consider a dataset of documents

from the Netherlands Brain Bank containing free text describing clinical and

pathological information about donors affected by Multiple Sclerosis. The goal is to

use CNMF for identifying clinical profiles with pathological information as constraints.

After pre­processing the documents by means of standard filtering techniques, a

feature representation of the documents in terms of bi­grams is constructed. The high

dimensional feature space is reduced by applying a trimming procedure. The resulting

datasets of clinical and pathological bi­grams are then clustered using non­negative

matrix factorization (NMF) and, next, clinical data are clustered using CNMF with

constraints induced by the clustering of pathological data. Results indicate the

presence of interesting clinical profiles, for instance related to vision or movement

problems. In particular, the use of CNMF leads to the identification of a clinical profile

related to diabetes mellitus. Pathological characteristics and duration of disease of the

identified profiles are analysed. Although highly promising, results of this investigation

should be interpreted with care due to the relatively small size of the considered

datasets.

</p><p><strong> Application of Evolutionary Algorithms for the Optimization of Genetic Regulatory

Networks

</strong><br/><em> Elise Rosati, Morgan Madec, Abir Rezgui, Quentin Colman, Nicolas

Toussaint, Christophe Lallement, Pierre Collet

</em><br/> Synthetic biology aims at reinvesting theoretical knowledge from various

domains (biology, engineering, microelectronics) for the development of new

biological functions. Concerning the design of such functions, the classical trial­error

approach is expensive and time consuming. Computer­aided design is therefore of

key interest in this field. As for other domains, such as microelectronics or robotics,

evolutionary algorithms can be used to this end. This article is a first step in this

direction: it describes the optimization of an existing artificial gene regulatory network

(a band­pass detector) using evolutionary algorithms. Evolutionary algorithms

successfully find a good set of parameters (the simulated response of the system

which fits at 99% the expected response) in about 200 seconds (corresponding to

5000 generations) on a standard computer. This is the proof of concept of our

approach. Moreover, results analysis allows the biologist not only to save time during

the design process but also to study the specificity of a system.

</p><p><strong> A Hybrid Discrete Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm for the Multicast Routing

Problem

</strong><br/><em> Yannis Marinakis, Magdalene Marinaki, Athanasios Migdalas

</em><br/> In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed for the solution of the Multicast

Routing Problem. The algorithm is based on the Artificial Bee Colony approach

hybridized with Variable Neighborhood Search. The quality of the algorithm is

evaluated with experiments conducted on suitably modified benchmark instances of

the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem from the TSP library. The results of the

algorithm are compared to results obtained by several versions of the Particle Swarm

Optimization algorithm. The comparisons indicated the effectiveness of the new

approach.

</p><p><strong> Evolving Coverage Optimisation Functions for Heterogeneous Networks using

Grammatical Genetic Programming

</strong><br/><em> Michael Fenton, David Lynch, Stepan Kucera, Holger Claussen, Michael

O'Neill

</em><br/> Heterogeneous Cellular Networks are multi­tiered cellular networks

comprised of Macro Cells and Small Cells in which all cells occupy the same

bandwidth. User Equipments greedily attach to whichever cell provides the best signal

strength. While Macro Cells are invariant, the power and selection bias for each small

cell can be increased or decreased (subject to pre­defined limits) such that more or

fewer UEs attach to that cell. Setting optimal power and selection bias levels for small

cells is key for good network performance. The application of Genetic Programming

techniques has been proven to produce good results in the control of Heterogenous

Networks. Expanding on previous works, this paper uses grammatical GP to evolve

distributed control functions for Small Cells in order to vary their power and bias

settings. The objective of these control functions is to evolve control functions that

maximise a proportional fair utility of UE throughputs.

</p><p><strong> Joint Topology Optimization, Power Control and Spectrum Allocation for Intra-
Vehicular Multi­hop Sensor Networks using Dandelion­encoded Heuristics

</strong><br/><em> Javier Del Ser, Miren Nekane Bilbao, Cristina Perfecto, Gonzalez­Pardo,

Sergio Campos­Cordobes

</em><br/> In the last years the interest in multi­hop communications has gained

momentum within the research community due to the challenging characteristics of

the intra­vehicular radio environment and the stringent robustness imposed on critical

sensors within the vehicle. As opposed to point­to­point network topologies, multi­hop

networking allows for an enhanced communication reliability at the cost of an

additional processing overhead. In this context this manuscript poses a novel bi-
objective optimization problem aimed at jointly minimizing 1) the average Bit Error

Rate (BER) of sensing nodes under a majority fusion rule at the central data collection

unit; and 2) the mean delay experienced by packets forwarded by such nodes due to

multi­hop networking, frequency channel switching time multiplexing at intermediate

nodes. The formulated paradigm is shown to be computationally tractable via a

combination of evolutionary meta­heuristic algorithms and Dandelion codes, the latter

capable of representing tree­like structures like those modeling the multi­hop routing

approach. Simulations are carried out for realistic values of intra­vehicular radio

channels and co­channel interference due to nearby IEEE 802.11 signals. The

obtained results are promising and pave the way towards assessing the practical

performance of the proposed scheme in real setups.

</p><p><strong> A Heuristic Crossover Enhanced Evolutionary Algorithm for Clustering Wireless

Sensor Network

</strong><br/><em> Muyiwa Olakanmi Oladimeji, Mikdam Turkey, Sandra Dudley

</em><br/> In this paper, a Heuristic­Crossover Enhanced Evolutionary Algorithm for

Cluster Head Selection is proposed. The algorithm uses a novel heuristic crossover

operator to combine two different solutions in order to achieve a high quality solution

that distributes the energy load evenly among the sensor nodes and enhances the

distribution of cluster head nodes in a network. Additionally, we propose the

Stochastic Selection of Inactive Nodes, a mechanism inspired by the Boltzmann

Selection process in genetic algorithms. This mechanism stochastically considers

coverage effect in the selection of nodes that are required to go into sleep mode in

order to conserve energy of sensor nodes. The proposed selection of inactive node

mechanisms and cluster head selections protocol are performed sequentially at every

round and are part of the main algorithm proposed, namely the Heuristic Algorithm for

Clustering Hierarchy (HACH). The main goal of HACH is to extend network lifetime of

wireless sensor networks by reducing and balancing the energy consumption among

sensor nodes during communication processes. Our protocol shows improved

performance compared with state­of­the­art protocols like LEACH, TCAC and SEECH

in terms of improved network lifetime for wireless sensor networks deployments.

</p><p><strong> An (MI)LP­based Primal Heuristic for 3­Architecture Connected Facility Location

in Urban Access Network Design

</strong><br/><em> Fabio D'Andreagiovanni, Fabian Mett, Jonad Pulaj

</em><br/> We investigate the 3­architecture Connected Facility Location Problem

arising in the design of urban telecommunication access networks integrating wired

and wireless technologies. We propose an original optimization model for the problem

that includes additional variables and constraints to take into account wireless signal

coverage represented through signal­to­interference ratios. Since the problem can

prove very challenging even for modern state­of­the art optimization solvers, we

propose to solve it by an original primal heuristic that combines a probabilistic fixing

procedure, guided by peculiar Linear Programming relaxations, with an exact MIP

heuristic, based on a very large neighborhood search. Computational experiments on

a set of realistic instances show that our heuristic can find solutions associated with

much lower optimality gaps than a state­of­the­art solver.

</p><p><strong> Reducing Efficiency of Connectivity­Splitting Attack on Newscast via Limited

Gossip

</strong><br/><em> Jakub Muszynski, Sebastien Varrette, Pascal Bouvry

</em><br/> Newscast is a Peer­to­Peer, nature­inspired gossip­based data exchange

protocol used for information dissemination and membership management in large-
scale, agent­based distributed systems. The model follows a probabilistic scheme

able to keep a self­organised, small­world equilibrium featuring a complex, spatially

structured and dynamically changing environment. Newscast gained popularity since

the early 2000s thanks to its inherent resilience to node volatility as the protocol

exhibits strong self­healing properties. However, the original design proved to be

surprisingly fragile in a byzantine environment subjected to cheating faults. Indeed, a

set of recent studies emphasized the hard­wired vulnerabilities of the protocol, leading

to an efficient implementation of a malicious client, where a few naive cheaters are

able to break the network connectivity in a very short time. Extending these previous

works, we propose in this paper a modification of the seminal protocol with embedded

counter­measures, improving the resilience of the scheme against malicious acts

without significantly affecting the original Newscast's properties nor its inherent

performance. Concrete experiments were performed to support these claims, using a

framework implementing all the solutions discussed in this work.

</p><p><strong> A Distributed Intrusion Detection Framework based on Evolved Specialized

Ensembles of Classifiers

</strong><br/><em> Gianluigi Folino, Francesco Sergio Pisani, Pietro Sabatino

</em><br/> Modern intrusion detection systems must handle many complicated issues

in real­time, as they have to cope with a real data stream; indeed, for the task of

classification, typically the classes are unbalanced and, in addition, they have to cope

with distributed attacks and they have to quickly react to changes in the data. Data

mining techniques and, in particular, ensemble of classifiers permit to combine

different classifiers that together provide complementary information and can be built

in an incremental way. This paper introduces the architecture of a distributed intrusion

detection framework and in particular, the detector module based on a meta-
ensemble, which is used to cope with the problem of detecting intrusions, in which

typically the number of attacks is minor than the number of normal connections. To

this aim, we explore the usage of ensembles specialized to detect particular types of

attack or normal connections, and Genetic Programming is adopted to generate a

non­trainable function to combine each specialized ensemble. Non­trainable functions

can be evolved without any extra phase of training and, therefore, they are particularly

apt to handle concept drifts, also in the case of real­time constraints. Preliminary

experiments, conducted on the well­known KDD dataset and on a more up­to­date

dataset, ISCX IDS, show the effectiveness of the approach.

</p><p><strong> UAV Fleet Mobility Model with Multiple Pheromones for Tracking Moving

Observation Targets

</strong><br/><em> Christophe Atten, Loubna Channouf, Gregoire Danoy, Pascal Bouvry

</em><br/> The last years, UAVs have been developed to address a variety of

applications ranging from searching and tracking to the surveillance of an area.

However, using a single UAV limits the range of possible applications. Therefore,

fleets of UAVs are nowadays considered to work together on a common goal which

requires novel distributed mobility management models. This work proposes a novel

nature­inspired mobility model for UAV fleets based on Ant Colony Optimisation

approaches (ACO). It relies on two types of pheromones, a repulsive pheromone to

cover the designated area in an efficient way, and an attractive pheromone to detect

and to track the maximum number of targets. Furthermore, all decision takings are

taken online by each UAV and are fully distributed. Experimental results demonstrate

promising target tracking performances together with a small increase in the

exhaustivity of the coverage.

</p><p><strong> Towards intelligent biological control: Controlling Boolean networks with Boolean

networks

</strong><br/><em> Nadia S. Taou, David W. Corne, Michael A. Lones

</em><br/> Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are the complex dynamical systems that

orchestrate the activities of biological cells. In order to design effective therapeutic

interventions for diseases such as cancer, there is a need to control GRNs in more

sophisticated ways. Computational control methods offer the potential for discovering

such interventions, but the difficulty of the control problem means that current

methods can only be applied to GRNs that are either very small or that are

topologically restricted. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach that uses

evolutionary algorithms to design GRNs that can control other GRNs. This is

motivated by previous work showing that computational models of GRNs can express

complex control behaviours in a relatively compact fashion. As a first step towards this

goal, we consider abstract Boolean network models of GRNs, demonstrating that

Boolean networks can be evolved to control trajectories within other Boolean

networks. The Boolean approach also has the advantage of a relatively easy mapping

to synthetic biology implementations, offering a potential path to in vivo realisation of

evolved controllers.

</p><p><strong> The Emergence of Cooperation in Public Goods Games on Randomly Growing

Dynamic Networks

</strong><br/><em> Steve Miller, Joshua Knowles

</em><br/> According to evolutionary game theory, cooperation in public goods games

is eliminated by free­riders, yet in nature, cooperation is ubiquitous. Artificial models

resolve this contradiction via the mechanism of network reciprocity. However, existing

research only addresses pre­existing networks and does not specifically consider their

origins. Further, much work has focused on scale­free networks and so pre­supposes

attachment mechanisms which may not exist in nature. We present a coevolutionary

model of public goods games in networks, growing by random attachment, from small

founding populations of simple agents. The model demonstrates the emergence of

cooperation in moderately heterogeneous networks, regardless of original founders’

behaviour, and absent higher cognitive abilities such as recognition or memory. It may

thus illustrate a more general mechanism for the evolution of cooperation, from early

origins, in minimally cognitive organisms. It is the first example of a model explaining

cooperation in public goods games on growing networks.

</p><p><strong> Influence Maximization in Social Networks with Genetic Algorithms

</strong><br/><em> Doina Bucur, Giovanni Iacca

</em><br/> We live in a world of social networks. Our everyday choices are often

influenced by social interactions. Word of mouth, meme diffusion on the Internet, and

viral marketing are all examples of how social networks can affect our behaviour. In

many practical applications, it is of great interest to determine which nodes have the

highest influence over the network, i.e., which set of nodes will, indirectly, reach the

largest audience when propagating information. These nodes might be, for instance,

the target for early adopters of a product, the most influential endorsers in political

elections, or the most important investors in financial operations, just to name a few

examples. Here, we tackle the NP­hard problem of influence maximization on social

networks by means of a Genetic Algorithm. We show that, by using simple genetic

operators, it is possible to find in feasible runtime solutions of high­influence that are

comparable, and occasionally better, than the solutions found by a number of known

heuristics (one of which was previously proven to have the best possible

approximation guarantee, in polynomial time, of the optimal solution). The advantages

of Genetic Algorithms show, however, in them not requiring any assumptions about

the graph underlying the network, and in them obtaining more diverse sets of feasible

solutions than current heuristics.

</strong><br/><em> Ewelina Swiderska, Jakub Lasisz, Aleksander Byrski,Tom Lenaerts, Dana

Samson, Bipin Indurkhya, Ann Nowe, Marek Kisiel­Dorohinicki

</em><br/> In our recent research, we implemented an enhancement of Ant Colony

Optimization incorporating the socio­cognitive dimension of perspective taking. Our

initial results suggested that increasing the diversity of ant population ­­­ introducing

different pheromones, different species and dedicated inter­species relations ­­­

yielded better results. In this paper, we explore the diversity issue by introducing novel

diversity measurement strategies for ACO. Based on these strategies we compare

both classic ACO and its socio­cognitive variation.

</p><p><strong> Multiwinner Voting in Genetic Algorithms for Solving Ill­Posed Global

Optimization Problems

</strong><br/><em> Piotr Faliszewski, Jakub Sawicki, Robert Schaefer, Maciej Smolka

</em><br/> Genetic algorithms are a group of powerful tools for solving ill­posed global

optimization problems in continuous domains. In case in which the insensitivity of the

fitness function is the main obstacle, the most desired feature of a genetic algorithm is

its ability to explore plateaus of the fitness function, surrounding its minimizers. In this

paper we suggest a way of maintaining diversity of the population in the plateau

regions, based on a new approach for the selection based on the theory of

multiwinner elections among autonomous agents. The paper delivers a detailed

description of the new selection algorithm, computational experiments that guide the

choice of the proper multiwinner rule to use, and a preliminary experiment showing the

proposed algorithm's effectiveness in exploring a fitness function's plateau.

</p><p><strong> A Decentralized PSO with Decoder for Scheduling Distributed Electricity

Generation

</strong><br/><em> Jorg Bremer, Sebastian Lehnhoff

</em><br/> A steadily increasing pervasion of the distribution grid with rather small

renewable energy resources imposes fluctuating and hardly predictable feed­in and

thus calls for new predictive load planning strategies. On the other hand, combined

with controllable, shiftable loads and electrical storages, these energy units set up a

flexibility potential for fine­grained control. To tap the full potential, distributed control

strategies are discussed for scheduling due to the expected large number of

controlled entities. Decoder strategies for unit independent algorithm implementation

and feasibility assurance had recently been applied to some first optimization

approaches for scheduling in smart grid. We extended a distributed particle swarm to

harnesses such decoder approach for model independent constraint­handling and

achieved a higher accuracy compared with other approaches. A multi swarm is

integrated after the island model into a decentralized agent­based solution and

compared with an established decentralized approach for predictive scheduling within

virtual power plants. We demonstrate the superiority of the particle swarm in terms of

achieved solution accuracy and the competitiveness in terms of sent messages.

</p><p><strong> Comparison of Multi­objective Evolutionary Optimization in Smart Building

Scenarios

</strong><br/><em> Marlon Braun, Thomas Dengiz, Ingo Mauser, Hartmut Schmeck

</em><br/> The optimization of operating times and operation modes of devices and

systems that consume or generate electricity in buildings by building energy

management systems promises to alleviate problems arising in today's electricity

grids. Conflicting objectives may have to be pursued in this context, giving rise to a

multi­objective optimization problem. This paper presents the optimization of

appliances as well as heating and air­conditioning devices in two distinct settings of

smart buildings, a residential and a commercial building, with respect to the

minimization of energy costs, CO2 emissions, discomfort, and technical wearout. We

propose new encodings for appliances that are based on a combined categorization

of devices respecting both, the optimization of operating times as well as operation

modes, e.g., of hybrid devices. To identify an evolutionary algorithm that promises to

lead to good optimization results of the devices in our real­world lab environments, we

compare four state­of­the­art algorithms in realistic simulations: ESPEA, NSGA­II,

NSGA­III, and SPEA2. The results show that ESPEA and NSGA­II significantly

outperform the other two algorithms in our scenario.

</p><p><strong> A hybrid genetic algorithm for the interaction of electricity retailers with demand

response

</strong><br/><em> Maria Joao Alves, Carlos Henggeler Antunes, Pedro Carrasqueira

</em><br/> In this paper a bilevel programming model is proposed for modeling the

interaction between electricity retailers and consumers endowed with energy

management systems capable of providing demand response to variable prices. The

model intends to determine the pricing scheme established by the retailer (upper level

decision maker) to the consumer (lower level decision maker) and the optimal load

schedule adopted by the consumer under this price setting. The lower level

optimization problem is formulated as a mixed­integer linear programming (MILP)

problem. A hybrid approach consisting of a genetic algorithm and an exact MILP

solver is proposed. The individuals of the population represent the retailer’s choices

(electricity prices). For each price setting, the exact optimal solution to the consumer’s

problem is obtained in a very efficient way using the MILP solver. An illustrative case

is analyzed and discussed.

</p><p><strong> Stigmergy­Based Scheduling of Flexible Loads

</strong><br/><em> Fredy Rios, Lukas Konig, Hartmut Schmeck

</em><br/> In this paper, we address the rescheduling of shiftable loads in a sub-
section of the power grid (micro­grid) to maximize the utilization of renewable energy

sources (RES). The objective is to achieve a schedule for all customers in the micro-
grid such that the RES output utilization is maximized. Customers correspond to

residential households provided with intelligent appliances with the ability to

recalculate their operation times. We propose an approach based on stigmergy to

efficiently find a close­to­optimal solution to the general problem. An empirical analysis

of the internal functioning of the algorithm is performed. Furthermore, the performance

of the algorithm is compared to a price­based approach.

</p><p><strong> Electrical Load Pattern Shape Clustering using Ant Colony Optimization

</strong><br/><em> Fernando Lezama, Ansel Y. Rodriguez, Enrique Munoz de Cote

</em><br/> Electrical Load Pattern Shape (LPS) clustering of customers is an important

part of the tariff formulation process. Nevertheless, the patterns describing the energy

consumption of a customer have some characteristics (e.g., a high number of features

corresponding to time series reflecting the measurements of a typical day) that make

their analysis different from other pattern recognition applications. In this paper, we

propose a clustering algorithm based on ant colony optimization (ACO) to solve the

LPS clustering problem. We use four well­known clustering metrics (i.e., CDI, SI, DEV

and CONN), showing that the selection of a clustering quality metric plays an

important role in the LPS clustering problem. Also, we compare our LPS­ACO

algorithm with traditional algorithms, such as k­means and single­linkage, and a state-
of­the­art Electrical Pattern Ant Colony Clustering (EPACC) algorithm designed for

this task. Our results show that LPS­ACO performs remarkably well using any of the

metrics presented here.

</p><p><strong> Optimization of Operation and Control Strategies for Battery Energy Storage

Systems by Evolutionary Algorithms

</strong><br/><em> Jan Muller, Matthias Marz, Ingo Mauser, Hartmut Schmeck

</em><br/> To support the utilization of renewable energies, an optimized operation of

energy systems is important. Often, the use of battery energy storage systems is

stated as one of the most important measures to support the integration of intermittent

renewable energy sources into the energy system. Additionally, the complexity of the

energy system with its many interdependent entities as well as the economic

efficiency call for an elaborate dimensioning and control of these storage systems. In

this paper, we present an approach that combines the forward­looking nature of

optimization and prediction with the feedback control of closed­loop controllers. An

evolutionary algorithm is used to determine the parameters for a closed­loop controller

that controls the charging and discharging control strategy of a battery in a smart

building. The simulation and evaluation of a smart residential building scenario

demonstrates the ability to improve the operation and control of a battery energy

storage system. The optimization of the control strategy allows for the optimization

with respect to variable tariffs while being conducive for the integration of renewable

energy sources into the energy system.

</p><p><strong>Orthogonally Evolved AI to Improve Difficulty Adjustment in Video Games

</strong><br/><em> Arend Hintze, Randal Olson, Joel Lehman

</em><br/> Computer games are most engaging when their difficulty is well matched to

the player's ability, thereby providing an experience in which the player is neither

overwhelmed nor bored. In games where the player interacts with computer­controlled

opponents, the difficulty of the game can be adjusted not only by changing the

distribution of opponents or game resources, but also through modifying the skill of

the opponents. Applying evolutionary algorithms to evolve the artificial intelligence that

controls opponent agents is one established method for adjusting opponent difficulty.

Less­evolved agents (i.e.\ agents subject to fewer generations of evolution) make for

easier opponents, while highly­evolved agents are more challenging to overcome. In

this publication we test a new approach for difficulty adjustment in games:

orthogonally evolved AI, where the player receives support from collaborating agents

that are co­evolved with opponent agents (where collaborators and opponents have

orthogonal incentives). The advantage is that game difficulty can be adjusted more

granularly by manipulating two independent axes: by having more or less adept

collaborators, and by having more or less adept opponents. Furthermore, human

interaction can modulate (and be informed by) the performance and behavior of

collaborating agents. In this way, orthogonally evolved AI both facilitates smoother

difficulty adjustment and enables new game experiences.

</p><p><strong> There can be only one: Evolving RTS Bots via joust selection

</strong><br/><em> Antonio Fernandez Ares, Pablo Garcia­Sanchez, Antonio Miguel Mora

Garcia, Pedro A. Castillo, Juan J. Merelo

</em><br/> This paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm for evolving game bots that

eschews an explicit fitness function using instead a match between individuals called

{\em joust} and implemented as a selection mechanism where only the winner

survives. This algorithm has been designed as an optimization approach to generate

the behavioural engine of bots for the RTS game Planet Wars using Genetic

Programming and has two objectives: first, to deal with the noisy nature of the fitness

function and second, to obtain more general bots than those evolved using a specific

opponent. In addition, avoiding the explicit evaluation step reduce the number of

combats to perform during the evolution and thus, the algorithm time consumption is

decreased. Results show that the approach performs converges, is less sensitive to

noise than other methods and it yields very competitive bots in the comparison against

other bots available in the literature.

</p><p><strong> Constrained Level Generation through Grammar­Based Evolutionary Algorithms

</strong><br/><em> Jose M. Font, Roberto Izquierdo, Daniel Manrique, Julian Togelius

</em><br/> This paper introduces an evolutionary method for generating levels for

adventure games, combining speed, guaranteed solvability of levels and authorial

control. For this purpose, a new graph­based two­phase level encoding scheme is

developed. This method encodes the structure of the level as well as its contents into

two abstraction layers: the higher level defines an abstract representation of the game

level and the distribution of its content among different inter­connected game zones.

The lower level describes the content of each game zone as a set of graphs

containing rooms, doors, monsters, keys and treasure chests. Using this

representation, game worlds are encoded as individuals in an evolutionary algorithm

and evolved according to an evaluation function meant to approximate the

entertainment provided by the game level. The algorithm is implemented into a design

tool that can be used by game designers to specify several constraints of the worlds to

be generated. This tool could be used to facilitate the design of game levels, for

example to make professional­level content production possible for non­experts.

</p><p><strong> Evolving Chess­like Games Using Relative Algorithm Performance Profiles

</strong><br/><em> Jakub Kowalski, Marek Szykula

</em><br/> We deal with the problem of automatic generation of complete rules of an

arbitrary game. This requires a generic and accurate evaluating function that is used

to score games. Recently, the idea that game quality can be measured using

differences in performance of various game­playing algorithms of different strengths

has been proposed; this is called Relative Algorithm Performance Profiles. We

formalize this method into a generally application algorithm estimating game quality,

according to some set of model games with properties that we want to reproduce. We

applied our method to evolve chess­like boardgames. The results show that we can

obtain playable and balanced games of high quality.

</p><p><strong> Online Evolution for Multi­Action Adversarial Games

</strong><br/><em> Niels Justesen, Tobias Mahlmann, Julian Togelius

</em><br/> We present Online Evolution, a novel method for playing turn­based multi-
action adversarial games. Such games, which include most strategy games, have

extremely high branching factors due to each turn having multiple actions. In Online

Evolution, an evolutionary algorithm is used to evolve the combination of atomic

actions that make up a single move, with a state evaluation function used for fitness.

We implement Online Evolution for the turn­based multi­action game Hero Academy

and compare it with a standard Monte Carlo Tree Search implementation as well as

two types of greedy algorithms. Online Evolution is shown to outperform these

methods by a large margin. This shows that evolutionary planning on the level of a

single move can be very effective for this sort of problems.

</p><p><strong> The story of their lives: Massive procedural generation of heroes' journeys using

evolved agent­based models and logical reasoning

</strong><br/><em> Ruben H. Garcia­Ortega, Pablo Garcia­Sanchez, Juan J. Merelo, Aranzazu

San­Gines, Angel Fernandez­Cabezas

</em><br/> The procedural generation of massive subplots and backstories in

secondary characters that inhabit Open World videogames usually lead to

stereotyped characters that act as a mere backdrop for the virtual world; however,

many game designers claim that the stories can be very relevant for the player's

experience. For this reason we are looking for a methodology that improves the

variability of the characters' personality while enhancing the quality of their backstories

following artistic or literary guidelines. In previous works, we used multi agent systems

in order to obtain stochastic, but regulated, inter­relations that became backstories;

later, we have used genetic algorithms to promote the appearance of high level

behaviors inside them. Our current work continues the previous research line and

propose a three layered system (Evolutionary computation ­ Agent­Based Model ­

Logical Reasoner) that is applied to the promotion of the monomyth, commonly known

as the hero's journey, a social pattern that constantly appears in literature, films, and

videogames. As far as we know, there is no previous attempt to model the monomyth

as a logical theory, and no attempt to use the sub­solutions for narrating purposes.

Moreover, this paper shows for the first time this multi­paradigm three­layered

methodology to generate massive backstories. Different metrics have been tested in

the experimental phase, from those that sum all the monomyth­related tropes to those

that promote distribution of archetypes in the characters. Results confirm that the

system can make the monomyth emerge and that the metric has to take into account

facilitator predicates in order to guide the evolutionary process.

</strong><br/><em> Sylvain Cussat­Blanc, Jean Disset, Stephane Sanchez

</em><br/> In this paper, we show how a dangerousness metric can be used to modify

the input of a gene regulatory network when plugged to a virtual car. In the context of

the 2015 Simulated Car Racing Championship organized during GECCO 2015, we

have developed a new cartography methodology able to inform the controller of the

car about the incoming complexity of the track: turns (slipperiness, angle, etc.) and

bumps. We show how this dangerousness metric improves the results of our controller

and outperforms other approaches on the tracks used in the competition.

</p><p><strong> Using Isovists to Evolve Terrains with Gameplay Elements

</strong><br/><em> Andrew William Pech, Chiou­Peng Lam, Philip Hingston,

Martin Masek

</em><br/> The virtual terrain for a video game generally needs to exhibit a collection of

gameplay elements, such as some areas suitable for hiding and others for large scale

battles. A key problem in automating terrain design is the lack of a quantitative

definition of terrain gameplay elements. In this paper, we ad­dress the problem by

proposing a representation for gameplay elements based on a combination of space-
based isovist measures from the field of architecture and graph­connectivity metrics.

We then propose a genetic algorithm­based approach that evolves a set of

modifications to an existing terrain so as to exhibit the gameplay element

characteristics. The potential for this approach in the design of computer game

environments is examined by generating terrain containing instances of the “hidden

area” game element type. Results from four preliminary tests are described to show

the potential of this research.

</em><br/> This paper presents a spatially­structured evolutionary algorithm (EA) to

procedurally generate game maps of different levels of difficulty to be solved, in

Gravityvolve!, a physics­based simulation videogame that we have implemented and

which is inspired by the n­body problem, a classical problem in the field of physics and

mathematics. The proposal consists of a steady­state EA whose population is

partitioned into three groups according to the difficulty of the generated content (hard,

medium or easy) which can be easily adapted to handle the automatic creation of

content of diverse nature in other games. In addition, we present three fitness

functions, based on multiple criteria (i.e:, intersections, gravitational acceleration and

simulations), that were used experimentally to conduct the search process for creating

a database of maps with different difficulty in Gravityvolve!

AI

</strong><br/><em> Stefan Rudolph, Sebastian von Mammen, Johannes Jungbluth, Jorg Hahner

</em><br/> Due to the manifold challenges that arise when developing an artificial

intelligence that can compete with human players, the popular realtime­strategy game

\SC\ (BW) has received attention from the computational intelligence research

community. It is an ideal testbed for methods for \textit{self­adaption at runtime}

designed to work in complex technical systems. In this work, we utilize the broadly-
used Extended Classifier System (XCS) as a basis to develop different models of BW

micro AIs: the Defender, the Attacker, the Explorer and the Strategist. We evaluate

theses AIs with a focus on their adaptive and co­evolutionary behaviors. To this end,

we stage and analyze the outcomes of a tournament among the proposed AIs and we

also test them against a non­adaptive player to provide a proper baseline for

comparison and learning evolution. Of the proposed AIs, we found the Explorer to be

the best performing design, but, also that the Strategist shows an interesting

behavioral evolution.

</p><p><strong> A Wrapper Feature Selection Approach to Classification with Missing Data

</strong><br/><em> Cao Truong Tran, Mengjie Zhang, Peter Andreae, Bing Xue

</em><br/> Many industrial and real­world datasets suffer from an unavoidable problem

of missing values. The problem of missing data has been addressed extensively in the

statistical analysis literature, and also, but to a lesser extent in the classification

literature. The ability to deal with missing data is an essential requirement for

classification because inadequate treatment of missing data may lead to large errors

on classification. Feature selection has been successfully used to improve

classification, but it has been applied mainly to complete data. This paper develops a

wrapper feature selection approach to classification with missing data and investigates

the impact of this approach. Empirical results on 10 datasets with missing values

using C4.5 for an evaluation and particle swarm optimisation as a search technique in

feature selection show that a wrapper feature selection for missing data not only can

help to improve accuracy of the classifier, but also can help to reduce the complexity

of the learned classification model.

</p><p><strong> Bare­Bone Particle Swarm Optimisation for Simultaneously Discretising and

Selecting Features For High­Dimensional Classification

</strong><br/><em> Binh Tran, Mengjie Zhang, Bing Xue

</em><br/> Feature selection and discretisation have shown their effectiveness for data

preprocessing especially for high­dimensional data with many irrelevant features.

While feature selection selects only relevant features, feature discretisation finds a

discrete representation of data that contains enough information but ignoring some

minor fluctuation. These techniques are usually applied in two stages, discretisation

and then selection since many feature selection methods work only on discrete

features. Most commonly used discretisation methods are univariate in which each

feature is discretised independently; therefore, the feature selection stage may not

work efficiently since information showing feature interaction may be destroyed in the

discretisation process. In this study, we propose a new method called PSO­DFS using

bare­bone particle swarm optimisation (BBPSO) for discretisation and feature

selection in a single stage. The results on ten high­dimensional datasets show that

PSO­DFS obtains a substantial dimensionality reduction for all datasets. The

classification performance is significantly improved or at least maintained on nine out

of ten datasets by using the transformed ``small'' data by PSO­DFS. Compared to

applying the two­stage approach which uses PSO for feature selection on the

discretised data, PSO­DFS achieves better performance on six datasets, and similar

performance on three datasets with a much smaller number of features selected.

</p><p><strong> Mutual Information Estimation for Filter Based Feature Selection Using Particle

Swarm Optimization

</strong><br/><em> Bach Hoai Nguyen, Bing Xue, Peter Andreae

</em><br/> Feature selection is a pre­processing step in classification, which selects a

small set of important features to improve the classifi­ cation performance and

efficiency. Mutual information is very popular in feature selection because it is able to

detect non­linear re­ lationship between features. However the existing mutual

information approaches only consider two­way interaction between features. In ad-
dition, in most methods, mutual information is calculated by counting approach, which

might lead to an inaccurate results. This paper proposes a filter feature selection

algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) named PSOMIE, which

employs a novel fitness function using nearest neighbor mutual information estimation

(NNE) to measure the quality of a feature set. PSOMIE is compared with using all

features and two traditional feature selection approaches. The experiment results

show that the mutual information estimation successfully guides PSO to search for a

small number of features while maintaining or improving the classification

performance over using all features and the traditional feature selection methods. In

addition, PSOMIE provides a strong con­ sistency between training and test results,

which may be used to avoid overfitting problem.

</p><p><strong> Speaker Verification on Unbalanced Data with Genetic Programming

</strong><br/><em> Roisin Loughran, Alexandros Agapitos, Ahmed Kattan, Anthony Brabazon,

Michael O'Neill

</em><br/> Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) is a highly unbalanced binary

classification problem, in which any given speaker must be verified against everyone

else. We apply Genetic programming (GP) to this problem with the aim of both

prediction and inference. We examine the generalisation of evolved programs using a

variety of fitness functions and data sampling techniques found in the literature. A

significant difference between train and test performance, which can indicate

overfitting, is found in the evolutionary runs of all to­be­verified speakers.

Nevertheless, in all speakers, the best test performance attained is always superior

than just merely predicting the majority class. We examine which features are used in

good­generalising individuals. The findings can inform future applications of GP or

other machine learning techniques to ASV about the suitability of feature­extraction

techniques.

</strong><br/><em> Mohammad Majid al­Rifaie, Tim Blackwell

</em><br/> This paper presents a novel reconstruction algorithm for binary tomography

based on the movement of particles. Particle Aggregate Reconstruction Technique

(PART) supposes that pixel values are particles, and that the particles can diffuse

through the image, sticking together in regions of uniform pixel value known as

aggregates. The algorithm is tested on four phantoms of varying sizes and numbers of

forward projections and compared to a random search algorithm and to SART, a

standard algebraic reconstruction method. PART, in this small study, is shown to be

capable of zero error reconstruction and compares favourably with SART and random

search.

</strong><br/><em> Yih­Chun Cheng, Tom Hartmann, Pei­Yun Tsai, Martin Middendorf

</em><br/> A population based ant optimization algorithm (PACO) for reconstructing

electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is proposed in this paper. In particular, the PACO

algorithm is used to find a subset of nonzero positions of a sparse wavelet domain

ECG signal vector which is used for the reconstruction of a signal. The proposed

PACO algorithm uses a time window for xing certain decisions of the ants during the

run of the algorithm. The optimization behaviour of the PACO is compared with two

random search heuristics and several algorithms from the literature for ECG signal

reconstruction. Experimental results are presented for ECG signals from the MIT­BIT

Arrhythmia database. The results show that the proposed PACO reconstructs ECG

signals very successfully.

</p><p><strong> Can Evolutionary Algorithms Beat Dynamic Programming for Hybrid

</strong><br/><em> Tobias Rodemann, Ken Nishikawa

</em><br/> Finding the best possible sequence of control actions for a hybrid car in

order to minimize fuel consumption is a well­studied problem. A standard method is

Dynamic Programming (DP) that is generally considered to provide solutions close to

the global optimum in relatively short time. To our knowledge Evolutionary Algorithms

(EAs) have so far not been used for this setting, due to the success of DP. In this work

we compare DP and EA for a well­studied example and find that for the basic scenario

EA is indeed clearly outperformed by DP in terms of calculation time and quality of

solutions. But, we also find that when going beyond the standard scenario towards

more realistic (and complex) scenarios, EAs can actually deliver a performance en par

or in some cases even exceeding DP, making them useful in a number of relevant

application scenarios.

Setting

</strong><br/><em> Annamaria Szenkovits, Noemi Gasko, Erwan Jahier

</em><br/> Reactive systems interact continuously with their environments. In order to

test such systems, one needs to design executable environment models. Such

models are intrinsically stochastic, because environment may vary a lot, and also

because they are not perfectly known. We propose an environment­model based

testing framework optimized for reactive systems, where Differential Evolution (DE) is

used to fine­tune the environment model and to optimize test input generation. In

order to evaluate the proposed method, we present a case study involving a real-
world SCADE system from the domain of railway automation. The problem

specification was proposed by our industrial partner, Siemens. Our experimental data

shows that DE can be used efficiently to increase the structural coverage of the

</p><p><strong> Workforce Scheduling in Inbound Customer Call Centres With a Case Study

</strong><br/><em> Goran Molnar, Domagoj Jakobovic, Matija Pavelic

</em><br/> Call centres are an important tool that businesses use to interact with their

clients. Their efficiency is especially significant since long queuing times can reduce

customer satisfaction. Assembling the call centre work schedule is a complex task that

needs to take various and often mutually conflicting goals into account. In this paper,

we present a workforce scheduling system suited for small to medium call centres and

adjusted to the needs of two real­world client institutions. The scheduling problem is to

minimise the difference between allocated and forecasted number of staff members

while also caring for numerous legal and organisational constraints as well as staff

preferences. A flexible constraint handling framework is devised to enable rapid

prototyping methodology used during the development. Based on it, two

metaheuristics are devised for schedule construction: GRASP and iterated local

search. Performance analysis and comparisons for these two methods are provided,

on a real­world problem example. The devised system is successfully implemented in

a real world setting of call centres at PBZCard, Croatian largest credit card vendor and

PBZ (Intesa Sanpaolo), one of the largest Croatian banks.

</strong><br/><em> Oliver Kramer

</em><br/> In blackbox function optimization, the results of fitness function evaluations

can be used to train a regression model. This meta­model can be used to replace

function evaluations and thus reduce the number of fitness function evaluations in

evolution strategies (ES). In this paper, we show that a reduction of the number of

fitness function evaluations of a (1+1)­ES is possible with a combination of a nearest

neighbor regression model, a local archive of fitness function evaluations, and a

comparatively simple meta­model management. We analyze the reduction of fitness

function evaluations on set of benchmark functions.

</p><p><strong> Validating the Grid Diversity Operator: an Infusion Technique for Diversity

Maintenance in Population­based Optimisation Algorithms

</strong><br/><em> Ahmed Salah, Emma Hart, Kevin Sim

</em><br/> We describe a novel diversity method named Grid Diversity Operator (GDO)

that can be incorporated into population­based optimization algorithms that support

the use of {\em infusion} techniques to inject new material into a population. By

replacing the random infusion mechanism used in many optimisation algorithms, the

GDO guides the containing algorithm towards creating new individuals in sparsely

visited areas of the search space. Experimental tests were performed on a set of 39

multimodal benchmark problems from the literature using GDO in conjunction with a

popular immune­inspired algorithm (opt­ainet) and a sawtooth genetic algorithm. The

results show that the GDO operator leads to better quality solutions in all of the

benchmark problems as a result of maintaining higher diversity, and makes more

efficient usage of the allowed number of objective function evaluations. Specifically,

we show that the performance gain from using GDO increases as the dimensionality

of the problem instances increases. An exploration of the parameter settings for the

two main parameters of the new operator enabled the performance of the operator to

be tuned empirically.

</p><p><strong> Benchmarking languages for evolutionary algorithms

</strong><br/><em> JJ Merelo, Pedro Castillo, Israel Blancas, Gustavo Romero, Pablo Garcia-
Sánchez, Antonio Fernandez­Ares, Víctor Rivas, Mario Garcia­Valdez

</em><br/> Although performance is important, several other issues should be taken

into account when choosing a particular language for implementing an evolutionary

algorithm, such as the fact that the speed of different languages when carrying out an

operation will depend on several factors, including the size of the operands, the

version of the language and underlying factors such as the operating system.

However, it is usual to rely on compiled languages, namely Java or C/C++, for

carrying out any implementation without considering other languages or rejecting

them outright on the basis of performance. Since there are a myriad of languages

nowadays, it is interesting however to measure their speed when performing

operations that are usual in evolutionary algorithms. That is why in this paper we have

chosen three evolutionary algorithm operations: bitflip mutation, crossover and the

fitness function OneMax evaluation, and measured the speed for several popular, and

some not so popular, languages. Our measures confirm that, in fact, Java, C and C++

not only are the fastest, but also have a behaviour that is independent of the size of

the chromosome. However, we have found other compiled language such as Go or

interpreted languages such as Python to be fast enough for most purposes. Besides,

these experiments show which of these measures are, in fact, the best for choosing

an implementation language based on its performance.

</p><p><strong> On the Closest Averaged Hausdorff Archive for a Circularly Convex Pareto Front

</strong><br/><em> Gunter Rudolph, Oliver Schutze, Heike Trautmann

</em><br/> The averaged Hausdorff distance has been proposed as an indicator for

assessing the quality of finitely sized approximations of the Pareto front of a

multiobjective problem. Since many set­based, iterative optimization algorithms store

their currently best approximation in an internal archive these approximations are also

termed archives. In case of two objectives and continuous variables it is known that

the best approximations in terms of averaged Hausdorff distance are subsets of the

Pareto front if it is concave. If it is linear or circularly concave the points of the best

approximation are equally spaced. Here, it is proven that the optimal averaged

Hausdorff approximation and the Pareto front have an empty intersection if the Pareto

front is circularly convex. But the points of the best approximation are equally spaced

and they rapidly approach the Pareto front for increasing size of the approximation.

</p><p><strong> The Diffusion­Equation Method (DEM) ­ sometimes synonymously called

</strong><br/><em> Paul Manns, Kay Hamacher

</em><br/> in optimization. The DEM continuously transforms the objective function by

a (Gaussian) kernel technique to reduce barriers separating local and global minima.

Now, the DEM can successfully solve problems of small sizes. Here, we present a

generalization of the DEM to use convex combinations of smoothing kernels in Fourier

space. We use a genetic algorithm to incrementally optimize the (meta­)combinatorial

problem of finding better performing kernels for later optimization of an objective

function. For two test applications we derive and show their transferability to larger

problems. Most strikingly, the original DEM failed on a number of the test instances to

find the global optimum while our transferable kernels ­ obtained via evolutionary

computations ­ were able to find the global optimum.

</p><p><strong> Implementing Parallel Differential Evolution on Spark

</strong><br/><em> Diego Teijeiro, Xoan C. Pardo, Patricia Gonzalez, Julio R. Banga, Ramon

Doallo

</em><br/> Metaheuristics are gaining increased attention as an efficient way of solving

hard global optimization problems. Differential Evolution (DE) is one of the most

popular algorithms in that class. However, its application to realistic problems results

in excessive computation times. Therefore, several parallel DE schemes have been

proposed, most of them focused on traditional parallel programming interfaces and

infrastructures. However, with the emergence of Cloud Computing, new programming

models, like Spark, have appeared to suit with large­scale data processing on clouds.

In this paper we investigate the applicability of Spark to develop parallel DE schemes

to be executed in a distributed environment. Both the master­slave and the island-
based DE schemes usually found in the literature have been implemented using

Spark. The speedup and efficiency of all the implementations were evaluated on the

Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud, concluding that the island­based solution

is the best suited to the distributed nature of Spark. It achieves a good speedup

versus the serial implementation, and shows a decent scalability when the number of

nodes grows.

</p><p><strong> ECJ+HADOOP: An Easy Way to Deploy Massive Runs of Evolutionary

Algorithms

</strong><br/><em> Francisco Chavez, Francisco Fernandez, Cesar Benavides­Alvarez, Daniel

Lanza, Juan Villegas, Leonardo Trujillo, Gustavo Olague, Graciela Roman

</em><br/> This paper describes initial steps towards allowing Evolutionary Algorithms

(EAs) researchers to easily deploy computing intensive runs of EAs on Big Data

infrastructures. Although many proposals have already been described in the

literature, and a number of new software tools have been implemented embodying

parallel versions of EAs, we present here a different approach. Given traditional

resistance to change when adopting new software, we try instead to endow the well

known ECJ tool with the MapReduce model. By using the Hadoop framework, we

introduce changes in ECJ that allow researchers to launch any EA problem on a big

data infrastructure similarly as when a single computer is used to run the algorithm. By

means of a new parameter, researchers can choose where the run will be launched,

whether in a Hadoop based infrastructure or in a desktop computer. This paper shows

the tests performed, how the whole system has been tuned to optimize the running

time for ECJ experiments, and finally a realworld problem is shown to describe how

the MapReduce model can automatically deploy the tasks generated by ECJ without

additional intervention.

</p><p><strong> Addressing high dimensional multi­objective optimization problems by

coevolutionary islands with overlapping search spaces

</strong><br/><em> Pablo Garcia­Sanchez, Julio Ortega, Jesús Gonzalez, Pedro A. Castillo,

Juan J. Merelo

</em><br/> Large­scale multi­objective optimization problems with many decision

variables have recently attracted the attention of researchers as many data mining

applications involving high dimensional patterns can be leveraged using them. Current

parallel and distributed computer architectures can provide the required computing

capabilities to cope with these problems once efficient procedures are available. In

this paper we propose a cooperative coevolutionary island­model procedure based on

the parallel execution of sub­populations, whose individuals explore different domains

of the decision variables space. More specifically, the individuals belonging to the

same sub­population (island) explore the same subset of decision variables. Two

alternatives to distribute the decision variables among the different sub­populations

have been considered and compared here. In the first approach, individuals in

different sub­population explore disjoint subsets of decision variables (i.e. the

chromosomes are divided into disjoints subsets). Otherwise, in the second alternative

there are some overlapping among the variables explored by individuals in different

sub­populations. The analysis of the obtained experimental results, by using different

metrics, shows that coevolutionary approaches provide statistically significant

improvements with respect to the base algorithm, being the relation of the number of

islands (subpopulations) to the length of the chromosome (number of decision

variables) a relevant factor to determine the most efficient alternative to distribute the

decision variables.

Grammatical Evolution

</strong><br/><em> œJ. Manuel Colmenar, J. Ignacio Hidalgo, Juan Lanchares, Oscar Garnica,

Jose­L. Risco­Martín, Ivan Contreras, Almudena Sanchez, J. Manuel Velasco

</em><br/> This paper presents a method for accelerating the evaluation of individuals

in Grammatical Evolution. The method is applied for identification and modeling

problems, where, in order to obtain the fitness value of one individual, we need to

compute a mathematical expression for different time events. We propose to evaluate

all necessary values of each individual using only one mathematical Java code. For

this purpose we take profit of the flexibility of grammars, which allows us to generate

Java compilable expressions. We test the methodology with a real problem: modeling

glucose level on diabetic patients. Experiments confirms that our approach

(compilable phenotypes) can get up to 300x reductions in execution time.

</p><p><strong> GPU Accelerated Molecular Docking Simulation with Genetic Algorithms

</strong><br/><em> Serkan Altuntas, Zeki Bozkus, Basilio B. Fraguela

</em><br/> Receptor­Ligand Molecular Docking is a very computationally expensive

process used to predict possible drug candidates for many diseases. A faster docking

technique would help life scientists to discover better therapeutics with less effort and

time. The requirement of long execution times may mean using a less accurate

evaluation of drug candidates potentially increasing the number of false­positive

solutions, which require expensive chemical and biological procedures to be

discarded. Thus the development of fast and accurate enough docking algorithms

greatly reduces wasted drug development resources, helping life scientists discover

better therapeutics with less effort and time. In this article we present the GPU­based

acceleration of our recently developed molecular docking code. We focus on

offloading the most computationally intensive part of any docking simulation, which is

the genetic algorithm, to accelerators, as it is very well suited to them. We show how

the main functions of the genetic algorithm can be mapped to the GPU. The GPU-
accelerated system achieves a speedup of around ~14x with respect to a single CPU

core. This makes it very productive to use GPU for small molecule docking cases.

</p><p><strong> Challenging Anti­virus through Evolutionary Malware Obfuscation

</strong><br/><em> Marco Gaudesi, Andrea Marcelli, Ernesto Sanchez, Giovanni Squillero,

Alberto Tonda

</em><br/> The use of anti­virus software has become something of an act of faith. A

recent study showed that more than 80% of all personal computers have anti­virus

software installed. However, the protection mechanisms in place are far less effective

than users would expect. Malware analysis is a classical example of cat­and­mouse

game: as new anti­virus techniques are developed, malware authors respond with

new ones to thwart analysis. Every day, anti­virus companies analyze thousands of

malware that has been collected through honeypots, hence they restrict the research

to only already existing viruses. This article describes a novel method for malware

obfuscation based an evolutionary opcode generator and a special ad­hoc packer.

The results can be used by the security industry to test the ability of their system to

react to malware mutations.

</p><p><strong> Leveraging Online Racing and Population Cloning in Evolutionary Multirobot

Systems

</strong><br/><em> Fernando Silva, Luis Correia, Anders Lyhne Christensen

</em><br/> Online evolution of controllers on real robots typically requires a prohibitively

long evolution time to synthesise effective solutions. In this paper, we introduce two

novel approaches to accelerate online evolution in multirobot systems. We introduce a

racing technique to cut short the evaluation of poor controllers based on the task

performance of past controllers, and a population cloning technique that enables

individual robots to transmit an internal set of high­performing controllers to robots

nearby. We implement our approaches over odNEAT, which evolves artificial neural

network controllers. We assess the performance of our approaches in three tasks

involving groups of e­puck­like robots, and we show that they facilitate: (i) controllers

with higher performance, (ii) faster evolution in terms of wall­clock time, (iii) more

consistent group­level performance, and (iv) more robust, well­adapted controllers.

</p><p><strong> Multi­Agent Behavior­Based Policy Transfer

</strong><br/><em> Sabre Didi, Geoff Nitschke,

</em><br/> A key objective of transfer learning is to improve and speed­up learning on

a target task after training on a different, but related, source task. This study presents

a neuro­evolution method that transfers evolved policies within multi­agent tasks of

varying degrees of complexity. The method incorporates behavioral diversity (novelty)

search as a means to boost the task performance of transferred policies (multi­agent

behaviors). Results indicate that transferred evolved multi­agent behaviors are

significantly improved in more complex tasks when adapted using behavioral diversity.

Comparatively, behaviors that do not use behavioral diversity to further adapt

transferred behaviors, perform relatively poorly in terms of adaptation times and

quality of solutions in target tasks. Also, in support of previous work, both policy

transfer methods (with and without behavioral diversity adaptation), out­perform

behaviors evolved in target tasks without transfer learning.

</p><p><strong> On­line Evolution of Foraging Behaviour in a Population of Real Robots

</strong><br/><em> Jacqueline Heinerman, Alessandro Zonta, Evert Haasdijk, A.E. Eiben

</em><br/> This paper describes a study in evolutionary robotics conducted completely

in hardware without using simulations. The experiments employ on­line evolution,

where robot controllers evolve on­the­fly in the robots' environment as the robots

perform their tasks. The main issue we consider is the feasibility of tackling a non-
trivial task in a realistic timeframe. In particular, we investigate whether a population of

six robots can evolve foraging behaviour in one hour. The experiments demonstrate

that this is possible and they also shed light on some of the important features of our

evolutionary system. Further to the specific results we also advocate the system itself.

It provides an example of a replicable and affordable experimental set­up for other

researches to engage in research into on­line evolution in a population of real robots.

</p><p><strong> Hybrid Control for a Real Swarm Robotics System in an Intruder Detection Task

</strong><br/><em> Miguel Duarte, Jorge Gomes, Vasco Costa, Sancho Moura Oliveira,

Anders Lyhne Christensen

</em><br/> Control design is one of the prominent challenges in the field of swarm

robotics. Evolutionary robotics is a promising approach to the synthesis of self-
organized behaviors for robotic swarms but it has, so far, only been shown in relatively

simple collective behaviors. In this paper, we explore the use of a hybrid control

synthesis approach to produce control for a swarm of aquatic surface robots that must

perform an intruder detection task. The robots have to go to a predefined area,

monitor it, detect and follow intruders, and manage their energy levels by regularly

recharging at a base station. The hybrid controllers used in our experiments rely on

evolved behavior primitives that are combined through a manually programmed high-
level behavior arbitrator. In simulation, we show how simple modifications to the

behavior arbitrator can result in different swarm behaviors that use the same

underlying behavior primitives, and we show that the composed behaviors are

scalable with respect to the swarm size. Finally, we demonstrate the synthesized

controller in a real swarm of robots, and show that the behavior successfully transfers

from simulation to reality.

</p><p><strong> Direct Memory Schemes for Population­based Incremental Learning in Cyclically

Changing Environments

</strong><br/><em> Michalis Mavrovouniotis, Shengxiang Yang

</em><br/> The population­based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithm is a

combination of evolutionary optimization and competitive learning. The integration of

PBIL with associative memory schemes has been successfully applied to solve

dynamic optimization problems (DOPs). The best sample together with its probability

vector are stored and reused to generate the samples when an environmental change

occurs. It is straight forward that these methods are suitable for dynamic environments

that are guaranteed to reappear, known as cyclic DOPs. In this paper, direct memory

schemes are integrated to the PBIL where only the sample is stored and reused

directly to the current samples. Based on a series of cyclic dynamic test problems,

experiments are conducted to compare PBILs with the two types of memory schemes.

The experimental results show that one specific direct memory scheme, where

memory­based immigrants are generated, always improves the performance of PBIL.

Finally, the memory­based immigrant PBIL is compared with other peer algorithms

and shows promising performance.

</p><p><strong> Simheuristics for the Multiobjective Nondeterministic Firefighter Problem in a

Time­Constrained Setting

</strong><br/><em> Krzysztof Michalak, Joshua D. Knowles

</em><br/> The firefighter problem (FFP) is a combinatorial problem requiring the

allocation of `firefighters' to nodes in a graph in order to protect the nodes from fire (or

other threat) spreading along the edges. In the original formulation the problem is

deterministic: fire spreads from burning nodes to adjacent, unprotected nodes with

certainty. In this paper a nondeterministic version of the FFP is introduced where fire

spreads to unprotected nodes with a probability $P_{sp}$ (lower than~1) per time

step. To account for the stochastic nature of the problem the simheuristic approach is

used in which a metaheuristic algorithm uses simulation to evaluate candidate

solutions. Also, it is assumed that the optimization has to be performed in a limited

amount of time available for computations in each time step. In this paper online and

offline optimization using a multipopulation evolutionary algorithm is performed and

the results are compared to various heuristics that determine how to place firefighters.

Given the time­constrained nature of the problem we also investigate for how long to

simulate the spread of fire when evaluating solutions produced by an evolutionary

algorithm. Results generally indicate that the evolutionary algorithm proposed is

effective for $P_{sp} \geq 0.7$, whereas for lower probabilities the heuristics are

competitive suggesting that more work on hybrids is warranted.

</p><p><strong> Benchmarking dynamic three­dimensional bin packing problems using discrete-
event simulation

</strong><br/><em> Ran Wang, Trung Thanh Nguyen, Shayan Kavakeb, Zaili Yang, Changhe Li

</em><br/> In this paper a framework is developed to generate benchmark problems for

dynamic three­dimensional (3D) bin packing problems (BPPs). This framework is able

to generate benchmark problems for different variants of BPPs by taking into account

potential uncertainty in real­world BPPs, which are uncertainties in dimensions, costs,

weights of upcoming items. This paper has three main contributions. First, a

benchmark generator framework is developed for the first time using an open source

discrete­event simulation platform. This framework generates benchmark problems for

BPPs by reproducing uncertainty in real­world BPPs. Second, this framework can be

integrated with any dynamic BPP algorithm so that the optimisation algorithm can be

run alongside the simulation to solve dynamic BPPs. Third, various performance

measures from the literature are included in the framework to evaluate the

optimisation algorithms from different perspectives. Thanks to the 3D visualisation

feature of this framework, the optimisation results can also be observed visually.

Finally, empirical experiments on a real­world BPP are conducted to verify these

contributions.

</p><p><strong> Genetic Programming Algorithms for Dynamic Environments

</strong><br/><em> Joao Macedo, Ernesto Costa, Lino Marques

</em><br/> Evolutionary algorithms are a family of stochastic search heuristics that

include Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Genetic Programming (GP). Both GAs and GPs

have been successful in many applications, mainly with static scenarios. However,

many real world applications involve dynamic environments (DE). Many work has

been made to adapt GAs to DEs, but only a few efforts in adapting GPs for this kind of

environments. In this paper we present novel GP algorithms for dynamic

environments and study their performance using three dynamic benchmark problems,

from the areas of Symbolic Regression, Classification and Path Planning.

Furthermore, we apply the best algorithm we found in the navigation of an Erratic

Robot through a dynamic Santa Fe Ant Trail and compare its performance to the

standard GP algorithm. The results, statistically validated, are very promising.

</p><p><strong> A Memory­Based NSGA­II Algorithm for Dynamic Multi­Objective Optimization

Problems

</strong><br/><em> Shaaban Sahmoud, Haluk Topcuoglu

</em><br/> Dynamic multi­objective optimization problems (DMOPs) have been rapidly

attracting the interest of the research community. Although static multi­objective

evolutionary algorithms have been adapted for solving the DMOPs in the literature,

some of those extensions may have high running time and may be inefficient for the

given set of test cases. In this paper, we present a new hybrid strategy by integrating

the memory concept with the NSGA­II algorithm, called the MNSGA­II algorithm. The

proposed algorithm utilizes an explicit memory to store a number of non­dominated

solutions using a new memory updating technique. The stored solutions are reused in

later stages to reinitialize part of the population when an environment change occurs.

The performance of the MNSGA­II algorithm is validated using three test functions

from a framework proposed in a recent study. The results show that performance of

the MNSGA­II algorithm is competitive with the other state­of­the­art algorithms in

terms of tracking the true Pareto front and maintaining the diversity.

</p><p><strong> Hybrid Dynamic Resampling Algorithms for Evolutionary Multi­objective

Optimization of Invariant­Noise Problems

</strong><br/><em> Florian Siegmund, Amos H.C. Ng, Kalyanmoy Deb

</em><br/> In Simulation­based Evolutionary Multi­objective Optimization (EMO) the

available time for optimization usually is limited. Since many real­world optimization

problems are stochastic models, the optimization algorithm has to employ a noise

compensation technique for the objective values. This article analyzes Dynamic

Resampling algorithms for handling the objective noise. Dynamic Resampling

improves the objective value accuracy by spending more time to evaluate the

solutions multiple times, which tightens the optimization time limit even more. This

circumstance can be used to design Dynamic Resampling algorithms with a better

sampling allocation strategy that uses the time limit. In our previous work, we

investigated Time­based Hybrid Resampling algorithms for Preference­based EMO. In

this article, we extend our studies to general EMO which aims to find a converged and

diverse set of alternative solutions along the whole Pareto­front of the problem. We

focus on problems with an invariant noise level, i.e. a flat noise landscape.
