<h2>17th European Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation</h2>
 <p>Evo<span class="red">Applications</span></a></span>, 
      the European Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation 
      -formerly known as EvoWorkshops- brings together researchers in a variety 
      of areas of application of Evolutionary Computation and other Nature-inspired 
      techniques. </p>
    <p> <span id="logo">Evo<span class="red">Applications</span>
      invites high quality contributions for its 17th edition, which will be held 
      as part of the Evo<span class="red">Star</span>
      2015 event in Copenhagen, Denmark, April 08-10 2015 and co-located within Evo<span class="red">Star</span> 
      with three related conferences: <a href="cfp_eurogp.html">Euro<span class="red">GP</span></a>, <a href="cfp_evocop.html">Evo<span class="red">COP</span></a> 
      and <a href="cfp_evomusart.html">Evo<span class="red">MUSART</span></a>.<br />
      </span> </p>
    <p><span id="logo">Evo<span class="red">Applications</span>
      2015 is composed of 13 tracks, each focusing on an area of application of 
      genetic and evolutionary computation and other related Computational Intelligence 
      fields. The following tracks will be running in 2015: </span> </p>
