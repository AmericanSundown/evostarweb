Recent events involving both natural disasters and human-made attacks have emphasised the importance of solving challenging problems in risk management, security and defence. Traditional methods have proven insufficient to address these problems and hence Computational Intelligence techniques present themselves as a more appealing alternative.

<h3>Areas of Interest and Contributions</h3>

We seek both theoretical developments and applications of Computational Intelligence to these subjects. All bio-inspired computational paradigms are welcome, mainly Genetic and Evolutionary Computation, but also Fuzzy Logic, Intelligent Agent Systems, Neural Networks, Cellular Automata, Artificial Immune Systems and others, including hybrids.
Topics include but are not limited to:

<ul>
<li>Cyber crime: anomaly detection systems, attack prevention and defence, threat forecasting systems, anti spam, antivirus systems, cyber warfare, cyber fraud</li>
<li>IT Security: Intrusion detection, behaviour monitoring, network traffic analysis</li>
<li>Resilient and self-healing systems</li>
<li>Risk management: identification, prevention, monitoring and handling of risks, risk impact and probability estimation systems, contingency plans, real time risk management</li>
<li>Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)</li>
<li>Military, counter-terrorism and other defence related aspects</li>
<li>Disaster relief and humanitarian logistics</li>
<li>Real-world applications of these subjects</li>
</ul>

<h3>PUBLICATION DETAILS</h3>

Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of EvoStar, published in a volume of the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science, which will be available at the Conference.Submissions must be original and not published elsewhere. The submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The authors of accepted papers will have to improve their paper on the basis of the reviewers comments and will be asked to send a camera ready version of their manuscripts. At least one author of each accepted work has to register for the conference and attend the conference and present the work.The reviewing process will be double-blind, please omit information about the authors in the submitted paper.

<h3>Submission Details</h3>
