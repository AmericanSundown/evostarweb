        <h2>Travel and accommodation bursaries for students<h2>
   </div>

<h3>Application deadline:  25 February 2015</h3>

<p> 
A limited number of travel bursaries &amp; pre-paid accommodation places will be available for those students whose papers have been accepted for EuroGP, EvoCOP, EvoMusArt and EvoApplications 2015.  Our intention is to offer assistance to as many students as possible and <strong>applications will only be accepted from those who have already registered for the conferences/workshops</strong>.  Do not apply for an EvoStar bursary until you have completed the registration process.  Priority will be given to post-graduate students whose EvoStar papers have been accepted, especially those travelling transcontinental journeys or from countries outside Europe facing real financial hardship. Providing part-support for conference travel or accommodation costs is meant to make it easier for individuals to obtain additional funding from their own institution, or from other sources.
 </p>

 <p>
There are two types of financial support:  for <strong>travel</strong> and for <strong>accommodation</strong>.
 </p>
 <p>
<strong>Travel bursaries</strong> are principally for students travelling inter-continental distances and are limited to a maximum 500 Euro, but the amount awarded may be less.  They are claimed retrospectively and original travel tickets/boarding passes, hotel or similar receipts must be submitted after the conferences for reimbursement.
 </p><p>
<strong>Accommodation bursaries</strong> are for pre-paid bed and breakfast accommodation for three nights and are primarily aimed at students residing within Europe.  Hotel rooms near the conference venue in Copenhagen have been reserved and costs will be paid directly by the organisers.   Individuals prepared to share in twin accommodation rooms are given high priority, but some single rooms will also be available.  You can specify with whom you would like to share, and you will not be asked to share with anyone who is not of similar gender, age and nationality.   Please note that several strong EvoStar friendships and even research collaborations have resulted from students sharing accommodation!
 </p><p>
We are trying to support as many EvoStar participants as possible with limited funds so please be realistic in your expectations of the support that can be offered.
