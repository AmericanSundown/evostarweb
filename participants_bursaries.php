        <h2>Travel and accommodation bursaries for students</h2>
   </div>
   TBA
   <!--

<h3>Application deadline:  20 February 2016</h3>

<h2><span class="red">NOTE: APPLICATION IS NOW CLOSED</span></h2>
<p>
A limited number of travel bursaries & pre-paid accommodation places will be available

to those whose papers have been accepted for EuroGP, EvoCOP, EvoMusArt and 

EvoApplications 2016.  We aim to offer assistance to as many students as possible and 

<strong>applications will only be accepted from those who have already registered for the 

EvoStar conferences</strong>.  Do not apply for an EvoStar bursary until you have completed 

the registration process, otherwise your application will be automatically rejected.  

Providing support for conference travel or accommodation costs is meant to make it 

easier for individuals to obtain additional funding from their own institution, or from other 

sources.
</p>

<p>There are two types of financial support:  for <strong>travel</strong> and for <strong>accommodation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Travel bursaries</strong> are principally for students travelling inter-continental distances from 

outside Europe.  Claims are made after the conference and require original travel 

tickets/boarding passes, hotel or similar receipts to be submitted with a claim form for 

reimbursement in April. </p>

<p><strong>Accommodation bursaries</strong> are for pre-paid accommodation for three nights and are 

primarily aimed at students residing within Europe.  Twin accommodation within the 

conference venue (Semin√°rio de Vilar) has been reserved and costs will be paid directly 

by the organisers.   Applications from those prepared to share in twin accommodation 

rooms are given the highest priority, but some single rooms will also be available.  You 

can specify with whom you would like to share, and you will not be asked to share with 

anyone who is not of similar gender or nationality.   Please note that several strong 

EvoStar friendships, and even research collaborations, have resulted from students 

meeting and sharing accommodation rooms at EvoStar conferences!
</p>

<p>
We are trying to support as many EvoStar participants as possible with limited funds so 

please be realistic in your expectations of the support that can be offered.
</p>

<p>

place if you are based in Europe, please complete asap the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/evostar16bursary">BURSARY APPLICATION 

FORM</a>, and not later than 20 February when final decisions will be taken.   If you have

BURSARY QUERY in your email subject header).</p>

<p>
The deadline for bursary applications is 20 February 2016 and decisions will be 

notified to all applicants by 23 February.
