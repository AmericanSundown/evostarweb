<p> The Bazel, centrally located  in the Amsterdam City Centre, is an impressive art deco building with a rich and royal history and dates back to the beginning of the twentieth century. Together with the Royal Palace on the Dam square, the City Hall and the Rijksmuseum it is counted amongst the most striking and beautiful historical buildings of Amsterdam. The building, named after its architect K.P.C.  de Bazel (1869-1923), was built between 1919 en 1926 for the ‘Nederlandsche Handel Maatschappij’ (Dutch Trading Company). This company, founded in 1824 by King Willem I, was founded to stimulate the reclining Dutch economy in the nineteenth century. It was mostly active in the trade of colonial goods and is therefore seen as the successor of the famous ‘Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie’ (VOC).

In March 1991 De Bazel was officially granted an historical monument status by the Dutch government. Today it is known as the most impressive building within the oeuvre of K.P.C. de Bazel because it so clearly reflects his interest in theosophical ideas and the old Egyptian and Assyrian cultures. Karel de Bazel intended his architectural designs to be in harmony with their environment and went on to create these eternal and timeless buildings , his intention was to communicate a divine message through his creations.
