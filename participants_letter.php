<p>
Letters of invitation to EvoStar 2014 for the purposes of obtaining a visa to enter Denmark are only prepared for authors of accepted papers or for genuine conference researchers working or studying at recognised academic or research institutions active in relevant subjects.  In addition, letters of invitation <strong> are not sent until registration fees have been paid in full</strong>.  
A letter of invitation can only be obtained by submitting this form.  Do not contact the conference organisers unless you have a particular enquiry, otherwise you will simply be re-directed to the form.  Genuine questions can be sent to the EvoStar Coordinator, <a href="mailto:j.willies@napier.ac.uk?subject=EvoStar%20letter%20of%20invitation">Jennifer Willies</a>.    Please include “EvoStar Letter of Invitation” in the subject header of your email.
</p>
<p>
Letters of invitation are sent to individual authors and each person should complete their own form.  Please allow plenty of time, as many consular offices require weeks to process an application, so submit your request for an invitation letter asap, remembering that it may take up to 10 working days for a reply from the EvoStar Coordinator. Please check with your local Spanish consular office to know the correct procedure in your country for the visa application process, as there are differences between countries.
