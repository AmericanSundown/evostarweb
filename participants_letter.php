Do not contact the conference organisers unless you have a particular enquiry, otherwise you will simply be re-directed to the form.

Please include “EvoStar Letter of Invitation” in the subject header of your email.

<p>
Letters of invitation are sent to individual authors and each person should complete their own form.  Please allow plenty of time, as many consular offices require weeks to process an application, so submit your request for an invitation letter asap, remembering that it may take up to 10 working days for a reply from the EvoStar Coordinator. Please check with your local Danish consular office to know the correct procedure in your country for the visa application process, as there are differences between countries.
