<p>Evo<span color="red">Star</span> welcomes displays of research projects, especially pan-European ones!</p>

<p>If you are involved in a research project relevant to bio-inspired computing, and you would like a chance to show off your project results during the EvoStar poster session, then please contact <a href="mailto:j.willies@napier.ac.uk">the EvoStar coordinator</a> no later than 5 March 2015.</p>

<p>
Most funded research has a dissemination requirement, and EvoStar can provide a useful audience for your project promotion.     In addition to a poster display board for Wednesday evening 8 April, we offer a free project listing with 250 word description in the conference handbook (copy deadline is strictly 9 March).  This promotional opportunity is offered without cost but is open only to registered EvoStar delegates.
