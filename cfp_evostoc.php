<h2>Evolutionary Algorithms and Meta-heuristics in Stochastic and Dynamic Environments</h2>


Many real-world optimisation problems are characterised by some type of uncertainty that needs to be accounted for by the algorithm used to solve the problem. These uncertainties include noise (noisy optimisation), approximations (surrogate-assisted optimisation), dynamics (dynamic/online optimisation problems) as well as the requirement for robust solutions (robust optimisation). Dealing with these uncertainties has become increasingly popular in stochastic optimisation in recent years and a variety of new techniques have been proposed. The objective of Evo<span class="red">STOC</span> is to foster interest in metaheuristics for stochastic and dynamic optimisation and to provide an opportunity for researchers to meet and to present and discuss the state-of-the-art in the field. Evo<span class="red">STOC</span> accepts contributions, both empirical and theoretical in nature, for any work relating to nature-inspired, metaheuristics and stochastic techniques applied to a domain characterised by one or more types of uncertainty.
