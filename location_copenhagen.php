   </div>

   <h3>How To Get To Copenhagen:</h3>

<h4>By Plane:</h4>

Copenhagen's airport has direct flights from many cities within Europe
and from some within the United States
(<a href="http://www.cph.dk/en/flight-info/route-map/">http://www.cph.dk/en/flight-info/route-map/</a>). The airport is located
on the island of Amager, which is a 20 minute Metro ride away from the
centre.

<h4>By Train:</h4>

Copenhagen can also conveniently be reached by direct internal trains
from Hamburg, Stockholm, Basel, and Amsterdam, among other
(<a href="http://www.dsb.dk/om-dsb/in-english/">http://www.dsb.dk/om-dsb/in-english/</a>). The Copenhagen Central Station
is around a 10 minute walk away from the conference venue.

<h3>From Copenhagen Airport to the Centre:</h3>

<h4>Metro:</h4>
<p>
After you exit the baggage reclaim area, keep walking straight to the
end of the terminal building. There are two elevators and a staircase
that lead to the airport metro station, which is located at the upper
level. To get to the city centre you will need to buy a ticket from
the DSB office (see below).
The airport is the terminal station of the M2 line, which means you
can board any metro. Make sure you are at the Metro station though;
there are other trains that leave from the airport.
</p>
<p>
If you have a hotel near the conference venue you should get off at
Kongens Nytorv station; it is approximately 10-15 mins walk to the
venue from Kongens Nytorv. Alternatively, you may take the A1 towards
Aved√∏re St. from Kongens Nytorv and exit at "Stormbroen,
Nationalmuseet" (3 stops).
</p>
<h4>Taxi:</h4>
A taxi ride from the airport to the city centre takes about 20 minutes.

A convenient resource for travel planning in and around Copenhagen is
Rejseplanen (<a href="http://www.rejseplanen.dk/">http://www.rejseplanen.dk/</a>).

<h3> Bicycle</h3>



Bicycles are by far the most popular and convenient mean of transportation in 

Copenhagen. There are more than 300km of bicycle lanes and many guided 

bicycle tours.

Bikes can be rented in almost all bike shops; moreover, a public bike sharing 

service called City Bike is also active in the city

<h4>Copenhagen City Bike</h4>

The first time you use the city bike you rent the bike by entering your credit card 

information and unlock the city bike on the small tablet which is located on the 

handlebars. The bikes can be returned to any station in the system.

You can register yourself as a user online before your rental and save some time.

<h3>Public Transportation</h3>

The public transportation in Copenhagen is very reliable, punctual, and it takes 

you everywhere. In Copenhagen the trains, Metro and busses (including 

waterbuses) can be accessed with the same ticket. All you need to know is how 

many zones you will pass on your journey. Note the Metro will take you from the 

airport to central Copenhagen in only 20 minutes.

<h4>Tickets</h4>

You can buy different kinds of tickets when using public transportation in 

Copenhagen. It all depends on how long you are staying in the city, and how 

much you are planning on using public transportation.

Always buy a ticket before boarding the train or metro. On-board the buses, you 

also have the possibility to buy your ticket from the driver, if you bring small 

change. The same ticket can be used in the metro, bus, train and harbour bus. 

Always have your ticket with you in case a conductor wants to see it. Travelling 

without a valid ticket will result in a fine.

<p>

The most convenient options you have for the tickets are:

<h4>Buses</h4>

The A-buses are the primary buses in central Copenhagen. They drive every 3-7 

minutes during rush hour (which is between 07:00-09:00 in the morning and 

15:30-17:30 in the afternoon) and usually about every 10 minutes before and 

after rush hour. The A-buses serve at all hours.

The S-buses drive every 5-10 minutes during rush hour and every 20 minutes 

outside of rush hour. The S-buses are faster than the A-busses due to fewer 

stops. They usually serve between 06:00 in the morning and 01:00 at night.

Night buses are in service between 01:00 and 05:00 in the night. You can 

recognise the bus stops by the grey colour of the bus stop signs. The night buses 

are all N buses, for an example 85N.

<h4>Metro</h4>

The metro is in service all day and all night, every day of the week.

There are 2-4 minutes between each train during rush hour, and 3-6 minutes 

outside rush hour and during the weekends. Friday and Saturday night (after 

01:00) trains arrive with a 7-15 minutes interval and a 20 minutes interval after 

midnight on weekdays (Sunday through Thursday).

Please note that maintenance of the rails may occur during the night, which can 

result in a slightly longer journey. The maintenance is between 01:00-01:25 and 

again between 04:15-04:45.

<h4>Trains</h4>

The S-trains run between 05:00 in the morning and 00:30 at night. Line F runs 

every 4-5 minutes, line A, B, C and E run every 10 minutes, and line H and Bx run 

every 20 minutes.

On Friday and Saturday the trains run once an hour between 01:00 and 05:00. 

However, line F runs every half hour during these hours.
