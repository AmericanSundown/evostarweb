</p><p><strong>A Hybrid Constructive Mat­heuristic Algorithm for The Heterogeneous Vehicle Routing Problem with

Simultaneous Pick­up and Delivery

</strong><br/><em>Baris Kececi, Fulya Altiparmak and Imdat Kara

</em><br/>In this paper, a variant of Vehicle Routing Problem, called Heterogeneous Vehicle Routing Problem

with Simultaneous Pick­up and Delivery (HVRPSPD), is considered. The HVRPSPD can be defined as

determining the routes and vehicle types on each route in such a way that the pickup and delivery demands of

each customer must be performed with same vehicle, while minimizing the total cost. We propose a

mathematical model for the problem and some valid inequalities for the model. Since the HVRPSPD is an NP-
hard problem, the proposed mathematical model can be used to find the optimal solution for the small­size

problems. Therefore we propose a hybrid mat­heuristic approach based on the formulation and Local Search

to solve medium and large­size HVRPSPDs. A series of experiments is performed to evaluate the

performance of proposed algorithm. Computational results show that hybrid mat­heuristic is computationally

efficient to find good quality of initial solutions.

</p><p><strong>A Property Preserving Method for Extending a Single­objective Problem Instance to Multiple Objectives

with Specific Correlations

</strong><br/><em>Ruby L. V. Moritz, Enrico Reich, Matthias Bernt and Martin Middendorf

</em><br/>A method is proposed to generate multi­objective optimization problem instances from a

corresponding single­objective instance. The user of the method can specify the correlations between the

generated the objectives. Different from existing instance generation methods the new method allows to keep

certain properties of the original single­objective instance. In particular, we consider optimization problems

where the objective is defined by a matrix, e.g., a distance matrix for the Traveling Salesperson problem (TSP)

or a flow matrix for the Quadratic Assignment problem. It is shown that the method creates new distance

matrices with specific correlations between each other and also have the same average distance and variance

of distances as the distance matrix of the original instance. This property is important, e.g., when the influence

of correlations between the objectives on the behavior of metaheuristics for the multi­objective TSP are

investigated. Some properties of the new method are shown theoretically. In an empirical analysis the new

method is compared with instance generation methods from the literature.

</p><p><strong>An Evolutionary Approach to the Full Optimization of the Traveling Thief Problem

</strong><br/><em>Nuno Lourenço, Francisco B. Pereira and Ernesto Costa

</em><br/>Real­World problems usually consist of several different small sub­problems interacting with each

other. These interactions promote a relation of interdependence, where the quality of a solution to one sub-
problem influences the quality of another partial solution. The Traveling Thief Problem (TTP) is a recent

benchmark that results from the combination of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Knapsack

Problem (KP). Thus far, existing approaches solve the TTP by fixing one of the components, usually the TSP,

and then tackling the KP. We follow in a different direction and propose an Evolutionary Algorithm that

addresses both sub­problems at the same time. Experimental results show that solving the TTP as whole

creates conditions for discovering solutions with enhanced quality, and that fixing one of the components might

compromise the overall results.

</p><p><strong>Construct, Merge, Solve & Adapt: Application to the Repetition­Free Longest Common Subsequence

Problem

</strong><br/><em>Christian Blum and Maria J. Blesa

</em><br/>In this paper we present the application of a recently proposed, general, algorithm for combinatorial

optimization to the repetition­free longest common subsequence problem. The applied algorithm, which is

labelled CONSTRUCT, MERGE, SOLVE & ADAPT, generates sub­instances based on merging the solution

components found in randomly constructed solutions. These sub­instances are subsequently solved by means

of an exact solver. Moreover, the considered sub­instances are dynamically changing due to adding new

solution components at each iteration, and removing existing solution components on the basis of indicators

about their usefulness. The results of applying this algorithm to the repetition­free longest common

subsequence problem show that the algorithm generally outperforms competing approaches from the

literature. Moreover, they show that the algorithm is competitive with CPLEX for small and medium size

problem instances, whereas it outperforms CPLEX for larger problem instances.

</p><p><strong>Deconstructing the Big Valley Search Space Hypothesis

</strong><br/><em>Gabriela Ochoa and Nadarajen Veerapen

</em><br/>The big valley hypothesis suggests that, in combinatorial optimisation, local optima of good quality

are clustered and surround the global optimum. We show here that the idea of a single valley does not always

hold. Instead the big valley seems to de­construct into several valleys, also called ‘funnels’ in theoretical

chemistry. We use the local optima networks model and propose an effective procedure for extracting the

network data. We conduct a detailed study on four selected TSP instances of moderate size and observe that

the big valley decomposes into a number of sub­valleys of different sizes and fitness distributions. Sometimes

the global optimum is located in the largest valley, which suggests an easy to search landscape, but this is not

generally the case. The global optimum might be located in a small valley, which offers a clear and visual

explanation of the increased search difficulty in these cases. Our study opens up new possibilities for

analysing and visualising combinatorial landscapes as complex networks.

</p><p><strong>Determining the Difficulty of Landscapes by PageRank Centrality in Local Optima Networks

</strong><br/><em>Sebastian Herrmann

</em><br/>The contribution of this study is twofold: First, we show that we can predict the performance of

Iterated Local Search (ILS) in different landscapes with the help of Local Optima Networks (LONs) with escape

edges. As a predictor, we use the PageRank Centrality of the global optimum. Escape edges can be extracted

with lower effort than the edges used in a previous study. Second, we show that the PageRank vector of a

LON can be used to predict the solution quality (average fitness) that can be achieved by ILS in different

landscapes.

</p><p><strong>Efficient Hill Climber for Multi­Objective Pseudo­Boolean Optimization

</strong><br/><em>Francisco Chicano, Darrell Whitley and Renato Tinós

</em><br/>Local search algorithms and iterated local search algorithms are a basic technique. Local search can

be a stand­alone search method, but it can also be hybridized with evolutionary algorithms. Recently, it has

been shown that it is possible to identify improving moves in Hamming neighborhoods for k­bounded pseudo-
Boolean optimization problems in constant time. This means that local search does not need to enumerate

neighborhoods to find improving moves. It also means that evolutionary algorithms do not need to use random

mutation as a operator, except perhaps as a way to escape local optima. In this paper, we show how

improving moves can be identified in constant time for multiobjective problems that are expressed as k-
bounded pseudo­Boolean functions. In particular, multiobjective forms of NK Landscapes and Mk Landscapes

are considered.

</p><p><strong>Evaluating hyperheuristics and local search operators for periodic routing problems

</strong><br/><em>Yujie Chen, Philip Mourdjis, Fiona Polack, Peter Cowling and Stephen Remde

</em><br/>Meta­heuristics and hybrid heuristic approaches have been successfully applied to Periodic Vehicle

Routing Problems (PVRPs). However, to be competitive, these methods require careful design of specific

search strategies for each problem. By contrast, hyperheuristics use the performance of low level heuristics to

automatically select and tailor search strategies. Hyperheuristics have been successfully applied to problem

domains such as timetabling and production scheduling. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of

hyperheuristic approaches to solving PVRPs. The performance of hyperheuristics is compared to published

performance of state­of­the­art meta­heuristics.

</p><p><strong>Evolutionary Algorithms for Finding Short Addition Chains: Going the Distance

</strong><br/><em>Stjepan Picek, Carlos A. Coello Coello, Domagoj Jakobovic and Nele Mentens

</em><br/>The problem of finding the shortest addition chain for a given exponent is of great relevance in

cryptography, but is also very difficult to solve since it is an NP­hard problem. In this paper, we propose a

genetic algorithm with a novel representation of solutions and new crossover and mutation operators to

minimize the length of the addition chains corresponding to a given exponent. We also develop a repair

strategy that significantly enhances the performance of our approach. The results are compared with respect

to those generated by other metaheuristics for instances of moderate size, but we also investigate values up to

127

­ 3. For those instances, we were unable to find any results produced by other metaheuristics for

2

comparison, and three additional strategies were adopted in this case to serve as benchmarks. Our results

indicate that the proposed approach is a very promising alternative to deal with this problem.

</p><p><strong>Experimental Evaluation of Two Approaches to Optimal Recombination for Permutation Problems

</strong><br/><em>Anton Eremeev and Julia Kovalenko

</em><br/>We consider two approaches to formulation and solving of optimal recombination problems arising as

supplementary problems in genetic algorithms for the Asymmetric Travelling Salesman Problem and the

Makespan Minimization Problem on a Single Machine. All four optimal recombination problems under

consideration are NP­hard but relatively fast exponential­time algorithms are known for solving them. The

experimental evaluation carried out in this paper shows that the two approaches to optimal recombination are

competitive with each other.

</p><p><strong>Hyperplane Elimination for Quickly Enumerating Local Optima

</strong><br/><em>Brian Goldman and William Punch

</em><br/>Examining the properties of local optima is a common method for understanding combinatorial-
problem landscapes. Unfortunately, exhaustive algorithms for finding local optima are limited to very small

problem sizes. We propose a method for exploiting problem structure to skip hyperplanes that cannot contain

local optima, allowing runtime to scale with the number of local optima instead of with the landscape size. We

prove optimality for linear functions and Concatenated Traps, and we provide empirical evidence of optimality

on NKq Landscapes and Ising Spin Glasses. We further refine this method to find solutions that cannot be

improved by flipping r or fewer bits, which counterintuitively can reduce total runtime. While previous methods

were limited to landscapes with at most 2

problems with 2

</p><p><strong>Limits to Learning in Reinforcement Learning Hyper­heuristics

</strong><br/><em>Fawaz Alanazi and Per Kristian Lehre

</em><br/>Learning mechanisms in selection hyper­heuristics are used to identify the most appropriate subset

of heuristics when solving a given problem. Several experimental studies have used additive reinforcement

learning mechanisms, however, these are inconclusive with regard to the performance of selection hyper-
heuristics with these learning mechanisms. This paper points out limitations to learning with additive

reinforcement learning mechanisms. Our theoretical results show that if the probability of improving the

candidate solution in each point of the search process is less than 1/2 which is a mild assumption, then

additive reinforcement learning mechanisms perform asymptotically similar to the simple random mechanism

which chooses heuristics uniformly at random. In addition, frequently used adaptation schemes can affect the

memory of reinforcement learning mechanisms negatively. We also conducted experiments on two well­known

combinatorial optimisation problems, bin­packing and flow­shop, and the obtained results confirm the

theoretical findings. This study suggests that alternatives to the additive updates in reinforcement learning

mechanisms should be considered.

</p><p><strong>Modifying Colourings between Time­steps to Tackle Changes in Dynamic Random Graphs

</strong><br/><em>Bradley Hardy, Rhyd Lewis and Jonathan Thompson

</em><br/>Many real world operational research problems can be formulated as graph colouring problems.

Algorithms for this problem usually operate under the assumption that the size and constraints of a problem

are fixed, allowing us to model the problem using a static graph. For many problems however, this is not the

case and it would be more appropriate to model such problems using dynamic graphs. In this paper we will

explore whether feasible colourings for one graph at time­step t can be modified into a colouring for a similar

graph at time­step t+1 in some beneficial manner.

</p><p><strong>Particle Swarm Optimisation with Sequence­Like Indirect Representation for Web Service Composition

</strong><br/><em>Alexandre Sawczuk da Silva, Yi Mei, Hui Ma and Mengjie Zhang

</em><br/>Automated Web service composition, which refers to the creation of a complex application from pre-
existing building blocks (Web services), has been an active research topic in the past years. The advantage of

having an automated composition system is that it allows users to create new applications simply by providing

the required parameters, instead of having to manually assemble the services. Existing approaches to

automated composition rely on planning techniques or evolutionary computing (EC) to modify and optimise

composition solutions directly in their tree/graph form, a complex process that requires several constraints to

be considered before each alteration. To improve the search efficiency and simplify the checking of

constraints, this work proposes an indirect Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)­based approach. The key idea

of the indirect approach is to optimise a service queue which is then decoded into a composition solution by

using a planning algorithm. This approach is compared to a previously proposed graph­based direct

representation method, and experiment results show that the indirect representation can lead to a greater (or

equivalent) quality while requiring a lower execution time. The analysis conducted shows that this is due to the

design of the algorithms used for building and evaluating the fitness of solutions.

</p><p><strong>Particle Swarm Optimization for Multi­Objective Web Service Location Allocation

</strong><br/><em>Boxiong Tan, Yi Mei, Hui Ma and Mengjie Zhang

</em><br/>Web service location allocation problem is an important problem in the modern IT industry. In this

34 binary strings, hyperplane elimination can enumerate the same

77 binary strings, and find all 4­bit local optima of problems with 2

paper, the two major objectives, i.e. deployment cost and network latency, are considered simultaneously. In

order to solve this new multi­objective problem effectively, we adopted the framework of binary Particle Swarm

Optimization (PSO) due to its efficacy that has been demonstrated in many optimization problems.

Specifically, we developed two PSO variants, one with weighted­sum fitness function (WSPSO) and the other

with dominance­based fitness function. Concretely, it uses the fast Non­dominate Sorting scheme, and thus is

called NSPSO. The experimental results showed that both PSO variants performed better than NSGA­II,

which is the one of the most commonly used multi­objective genetic algorithms. Furthermore, we have found

that NSPSO achieved a more diverse set of solutions than WSPSO, and thus covers the Pareto front better.

This demonstrates the efficacy of using the dominance­based fitness function in solving multi­objective Web

service location allocation problem.

</p><p><strong>Sim­EDA: A Multipopulation Estimation of Distribution Algorithm Based on Problem Similarity

</strong><br/><em>Krzysztof Michalak

</em><br/>In this paper a new estimation of distribution algorithm Sim­EDA is presented. This algorithm

combines a multipopulation approach with distribution modelling. The proposed approach is to tackle several

similar instances of the same optimization problem at once. Each subpopulation is assigned to a different

instance and a migration mechanism is used for transferring information between the subpopulations. The

migration process can be performed using one of the proposed strategies: two based on similarity between

problem instances and one which migrates specimens between subpopulations with uniform probability.

Similarity of problem instances is expressed numerically and the value of the similarity function is used for

determining how likely a specimen is to migrate between two populations. The Sim­EDA algorithm is a general

framework which can be used with various EDAs. The presented algorithm has been tested on several

instances of the Max­Cut and TSP problems using three different migration strategies and without migration.

The results obtained in the experiments confirm, that the performance of the algorithm is improved when

information is transferred between subpopulations assigned to similar instances of the problem. The migration

strategy which transfers specimens between the most similar problem instances consistently produces better

results than the algorithm without migration.

</p><p><strong>Solving the Quadratic Assignment Problem with Cooperative Parallel Extremal Optimization

</strong><br/><em>Danny Munera, Daniel Diaz and Salvador Abreu

</em><br/>Several real­life applications can be stated in terms of the Quadratic Assignment Problem. Finding

an optimal assignment is computationally very difficult, for many useful instances. We address this problem

using a local search technique, based on Extremal Optimization and present experimental evidence that this

approach is competitive. Moreover, cooperative parallel versions of our solver improve performance so much

that large and hard instances can be solved quickly.
