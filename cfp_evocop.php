<h2>The 15th European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial 
      Optimisation</h2>
    <p>April 08-10, 2015<br />
      Copenhagen, Denmark</p>
    <p>Part of Evo<span class="red">*</span> 2015 (<a href="http://www.evostar.org">http://www.evostar.org</a>) 
      including: Euro<span class="red">GP</span>, Evo<span class="red">COP</span>, Evo<span class="red">MUSART</span> and 
      Evo<span class="red">Applications</span><br />
    </p>
    <p>The 15th European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial 
      Optimisation is a multidisciplinary conference that brings together researchers 
      working on metaheuristics for solving difficult combinatorial optimization 
      problems appearing in various industrial, economic, and scientific domains. 
      Prominent examples of metaheuristics include: evolutionary algorithms, simulated 
      annealing, tabu search, scatter search and path relinking, memetic algorithms, 
      ant colony and bee colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, variable 
      neighbourhood search, iterated local search, greedy randomized adaptive 
      search procedures, estimation of distribution algorithms, and hyperheuristics. 
      Successfully solved problems include scheduling, timetabling, network design, 
      transportation and distribution problems, vehicle routing, travelling salesman, 
      graph problems, satisfiability, energy optimization problems, packing problems, 
      planning problems, and general mixed integer programming.</p>
    <p>The Evo<span class="red">COP</span> 2015 conference will be held in the 
      city of Copenhagen, Denmark. It will be held in conjunction 
      with Euro<span class="red">GP</span> (the 18th European Conference on Genetic 
      Programming), Evo<span class="red">MUSART</span> (13th European conference 
      on evolutionary and biologically inspired music, sound, art and design) 
      and Evo<span class="red">Applications</span> (specialist events on a range 
      of evolutionary computation topics and applications), in a joint event collectively 
      known as Evo<span class="red">*</span>.</p>
