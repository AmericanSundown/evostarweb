This year's edition is technically sponsored by the World Federation on
Soft Computing (<a href="http://softcomputing.org">http://softcomputing.org</a>).

<p><img src="img/wfsclogo.jpg" /></p>

Evo<span class="red">COMNET</span> solicits contributions dealing with the application of ideas from natural processes and systems to the definition, analysis, and development of novel sequential, parallel, and distributed evolutionary computation approaches to the solution of problems of practical and theoretical interest in all domains related to network systems. Use and tuning of hybrid computational approaches based on evolutionary techniques are also welcome.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li><em>Communication systems</em>: Telecommunication, mobile, satellite, voice, and optical communications, Distributed inference and cooperative communication systems, Network analysis and design, Switching and Routing</li>
<li><em>Networks: Sensor networks</em>, Mobile ad hoc networks, Peer-to-peer networks, Distributed search and computing in peer-to-peer networks, Network protection systems, Network robotics and sensor-actor networks</li>
<li><em>Network-related issues</em>: Parallel and distributed optimization algorithms, Grid and cloud computing, Load balancing, routing, scheduling, and mapping in network-based computing systems, Quality-of-service provisioning, Distributed data mining</li>
<li><em>Abstract network systems</em>: Transportation, Supply, Logistics, Traffic management and simulation, Social network systems, Financial and economic network systems</li>
<li><em>Real-world implementations</em></li>
</ul>



<h3>SUBMISSION DETAILS</h3>
<p>Submissions must be original and not published elsewhere. They will be
peer reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.
The reviewing process will be double-blind, so please omit information
about the authors in the submitted paper.</p>

<p>Submit your manuscript in <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">Springer LNCS format</a>.</p>

<p>Please provide up to five keywords in your Abstract</p>

<p>Page limit: 16 pages.</p>



<h3>PUBLICATION DETAILS</h3>
<p>Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of EvoStar, published in a volume of the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 
which will be available at the Conference. The authors of accepted papers will have to improve their paper on the basis of the reviewers 
comments and will be asked to send a camera ready version of their manuscripts. At least one author of each accepted work has to register for the 
conference and attend the conference and present the work.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a selection of the best accepted papers, suitably revised
and extended, will be eligible for fast-track publication in Applied Soft
Computing journal by Elsevier (Impact Factor 2.810), thanks to the
technical sponsorship offered by the World Federation on Soft Computing.</p>
