<p><strong>Evolutionary Algorithms in Energy Applications<p></strong>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Along with the worldwide incentive to reduce fossil and nuclear based power
generation, the number of distributed generators and other forms of
distributed energy resources which are installed in power networks has been
steadily increasing over the last years. This increased integration has
triggered a transformation of the energy system and challenges the
conventional operation of these networks.</p>

<p>On a network level, this transformation requires new control and communication
approaches, to guarantee the security of energy supplies as well as an optimal
exploitation of available resources. On a generator level, advanced control
strategies as well as morphological optimization (e.g., tuning of wind-blade
design) can help to assure an optimal performance of the generator.</p>

<p>EvoEnergy is intended as a platform for new, innovative computational
intelligence and nature-inspired techniques in the domain of energy-related
optimization research. We seek contributions ranging from new control concepts
for decentralized generation, strategies for their coordination in the network
to the morphological optimization of distributed generators.</p>

<h3>Topics</h3>

<h3>Publication details</h3>

<p>Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of EvoStar, published in a
volume of the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science, which will be
available at the Conference.</p>

<p>Submissions must be original and not published elsewhere. The submissions will
be peer reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The
authors of accepted papers will have to improve their paper on the basis of
the reviewers comments and will be asked to send a camera ready version of
their manuscripts. At least one author of each accepted work has to register
for the conference and attend the conference and present the work. The
reviewing process will be double-blind, please omit information about the
authors in the submitted paper.</p>
