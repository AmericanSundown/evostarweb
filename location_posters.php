  <h3>Poster Board Sizes</h3>
Poster boards are portrait configuration:  140 cm tall by 100 cm wide and can accommodate posters of A0 size.  Pins are the best fixing materials.  Storage for posters will be available at the registration desk.  The poster stands will be set out on Wednesday around 1730. 
 
<h3>Poster Printing</h3>
If looking for a local printer to avoid carrying your poster, a printing shop near the venue offers the facility to upload files beforehand and then just pick up when you arrive.  However prices are not cheap : A0 size is 429 DKK (approx 50 EUR) and A1 is 260 DKK (approx 30 EUR).  For more information, see www.vesterkopi.dk/en/find-a-shop/norregade

 
<h3>Equipment</h3>
Data projectors (beamers) are available in each conference room but computers are not supplied, so best to bring your laptop or make sharing arrangements with others.
 
<h3>WIFI</h3>
Free guest wireless internet access is available for Evo* participants with two networks available.
 
<h3>Voltage and Adapters</h3>
Voltage in Denmark is 230v operating at 50 Hz frequency, similar to most European countries at 220-240v (North America is 110-120v).  Denmark uses the European two pin type C/E/F sockets.  Power cables from North and South America, the UK, and many parts of Asia will need plug adapters.   Most laptops (and camera/phone chargers) will adapt to the voltage automatically, but it is worth checking as some equipment brought in from outside Europe may need a voltage converter as well as a plug adapter.
