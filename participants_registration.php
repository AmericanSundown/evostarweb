These co-located events will be held in Porto, Portugal on 30 March 1 April 2016.</p>

<p>The single registration fee allows access to all events over three days and includes lunches and coffee breaks at the conference venue; one ticket for the conference reception and one ticket for the conference dinner (additional tickets available for purchase).  Also included is a USB stick with all EvoStar2016 conference proceedings and electronic access for these LNCS volumes will be available for a limited period before and after the EvoStar events via www.springerlink.com.  Hard copy volumes are <strong>NOT</strong> included as part of the registration fee but are available for separate purchase directly from Springer.</p>

<p>The friendly and informal atmosphere at EvoStar is intended to foster beneficial friendships and longer-term collaboration across continents and across research generations.</p>

<p><strong>The early booking discount is given to all registrations received by 25 February 2016</strong>, and you are encouraged to take advantage of the lower fees.  The reduced registration rate will automatically cease after 1 March and thereafter registrations will be charged at the higher rate (no exceptions). The organisers work hard to minimise conference fees, and the 2016 registration rates represent a decrease to previous rates in real terms.  Conference registrations are available on a first-come, first-served basis, with the organisers reserving the right to limit places if necessary. <strong>Registrations close on 24 March 2016</strong>, a week before the events commence and just before the Easter weekend.
