<p>Evo<span class="red">Star</span>2015 is the name for the four co-located conferences of Euro<span class="red">GP</span>, Evo<span class="red">COP</span>, Evo<span class="red">MusArt</span> and also Evo<span class="red">Applications</span> including conference tracks of Evo<span class="red">BIO</span>, Evo<span class="red">COMNET</span>, Evo<span class="red">COMPLEX</span>, Evo<span class="red">ENERGY</span>, Evo<span class="red">FIN</span>, Evo<span class="red">GAMES</span>, Evo<span class="red">IASP</span>, Evo<span class="red">INDUSTRY</span>, Evo<span class="red">NUM</span>, Evo<span class="red">PAR</span>, Evo<span class="red">RISK</span>, Evo<span class="red">ROBOT</span>, Evo<span class="red">STOC</span>.  These co-located events will be held in Copenhagen, Denmark on 8-10 April 2015.</p>

<p>The single registration fee allows access to all events over three days and includes lunches and coffee breaks at the conference venue; one ticket for the conference reception and one ticket for the conference dinner (additional tickets available for purchase).  Also included is a USB stick with all EvoStar2015 conference proceedings and electronic access for these LNCS volumes will be available for a limited period before and after the EvoStar events via www.springerlink.com.  Hard copy volumes are <strong>NOT</strong> included as part of the registration fee but are available for separate purchase directly from Springer.</p>

<p>The friendly and informal atmosphere at EvoStar is intended to foster beneficial friendships and longer-term collaboration across continents and across research generations.</p>

<p><strong>The early booking discount is given to all registrations received by 1 March 2015</strong>, and you are encouraged to take advantage of the lower fees.  The reduced registration rate will automatically cease after 1 March and thereafter registrations will be charged at the higher rate (no exceptions). The organisers work hard to minimise conference fees, and the 2015 registration rates represent a decrease to previous rates in real terms.  Conference registrations are available on a first-come, first-served basis, with the organisers reserving the right to limit places if necessary. <strong>Registrations close on 31 March 2015</strong>, a week before the events commence and just before the Easter weekend. <strong>Half price student discounts are available</strong> for those registered at appropriate academic organisations, who are able to prove their student status if asked to do so.  </p>

<p>Online registration and payment are available via a SSL secure website operated by Edinburgh Napier University in conjunction with Thawte as verified by VISA and MASTERCARD.  Online payment can be made using VISA, MASTERCARD, VISA DEBIT, VISA ELECTRON.  Please note that payment is charged in British pounds sterling at the rates shown below, with Euro fees described as an approximate guide.
