<strong>NEW THIS YEAR: LEONARDO Gallery</strong>
    <p>
      <br />
     The journal LEONARDO will be publishing a Gallery Section (online and in the 
print edition) associated with the conference. This will consist of a number 
of visual artworks based on ideas and techniques presented at the conference. 
A separate call for this will be issued after papers have been selected for 
the conference.

    </p>
    <p>Following the success of previous events and the importance of the field 
      of evolutionary and biologically inspired (artificial neural network, swarm, 
      alife) music, sound, art and design, evomusart has become an evo* conference 
      with independent proceedings since 2012. Thus, evomusart 2015 is the fourth International Conference on Evolutionary and 
      Biologically Inspired Music, Sound, Art and Design.</p>
    <p>The use of biologically inspired techniques for the development of artistic 
      systems is a recent, exciting and significant area of research. There is 
      a growing interest in the application of these techniques in fields such 
      as: visual art and music generation, analysis, and interpretation; sound 
      synthesis; architecture; video; poetry; design; and other creative tasks.</p>
    <p>The main goal of evo<span class="red">musart</span> 2015 is to bring together researchers who are 
      using biologically inspired computer techniques for artistic tasks, providing 
      the opportunity to promote, present and discuss ongoing work in the area. 
    </p>
    <p>The event will be held in April, 2015 in Copenhagen, Denmark, as
      part of the evo<span class="red">*</span> event.</p>
    <h2><br />
      Publication Details </h2>
<p>Submissions will be rigorously reviewed for scientific and artistic merit. Accepted papers will be presented orally or as posters at the event and included in the evomusart proceedings, published by Springer Verlag in a dedicated volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The acceptance rate at evomusart 2014 was 26.7% for papers accepted for oral presentation, or 36.7% for oral and poster presentation combined. </p>

<p>Submitters are strongly encouraged to provide in all papers a link for download of media demonstrating their results, whether music, images, video, or other media types. Links should be anonymised for double-blind review, e.g. using a URL shortening service.</p>
    <h2>Topics of interest </h2>
    <p>Submissions should concern the use of biologically inspired computer techniques 
      -- e.g. Evolutionary Computation, Artificial Life, Artificial Neural Networks, 
      Swarm Intelligence, other artificial intelligence techniques -- in the generation, 
      analysis and interpretation of art, music, design, architecture and other 
      artistic fields. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

      <li> Systems that resort to biologically inspired computation to perform 
        the analysis of image, music, sound, sculpture, or some other types of 
        artistic object. </li>
    </ul>
