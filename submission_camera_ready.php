<p>
Springer reprocesses all the contributions, meaning that you have to provide all source files and figures.
</p>

You should prepare a single tgz or zip-file containing a single directory with all of the necessary files (and all the necessary .sty files).

The name of the directory should be the last name of the first
author.

The directory has to contain:

<ul>
<li><strong>Latex .tex file</strong> (named with the last name of the first author).</li>

<li><strong>Latex .bbl file</strong>, if references are in a separate file (named with the last name of the first author).</li>

<li><strong>All figures</strong> (.ps or .eps).</li>

<li><strong>Final .dvi file</strong> (named with the last name of the first author).</li>

<li><strong>Final .ps file</strong> (named with the last name of the first author).</li>

<li><strong>Final .pdf file</strong> (named with the last name of the first author).</li>

<li><strong>.rtf file</strong> if another word processing program other than Latex was used (named with the last name of the first author).</li>

<li><strong>authors.txt</strong> : This file should have one line for each author of the paper using the following format:

<br/>
<em>[first names of first author] [last name of first author] [email]<br/>
[first names of second author] [last name of second author] [email]<br/></em>
<br/>
Please mark the contact author with * at the end of the line.<br/><br/>

Example of a paper authored by Mario Rossi and Jos'e Salgado:<br/>
<em>Mario Rossi mario.rossi@myuni.xy<br/>
Jos'e Salgado jsagado@hisuni.yx*<br/></em>
</li>
<li><strong>abstract.txt</strong> : This file should have the following structure:</li>

first line: title of the paper<br/>
second line: blank<br/>
remaining lines: abstract of the paper (in ASCII without line breaks).</br>
<li><strong>Scanned signed copyright</strong> form as PDF using the following filename:</li>

<em>[last_name_of_first_author]cr.pdf<br/></em>
(one author may sign on behalf of all authors of a paper).<br/>
Please note that the title of the conference should be entered as either:<br/>
Euro<span class="red">GP</span> 2015, Evo<span class="red">COP</span> 2015 Evo<span class="red">MUSART</span> 2015 or Evo<span class="red">Applications</span> 2015
</li>
</ul>
Also, before <strong>21 January 2015</strong>, you also have to send an <strong>E-mail</strong> to j.willies@napier.ac.uk with the title:

<p>
"EvoStar15 attendance confirmation"<br/>
which includes the following information:<br/>
1. Name of (co)author who will attend EvoStar2015 ________<br/>
2. If attendee is a student, their advisor ___________ has been cc-ed into this mail<br/>
3. If a VISA is required for the attendee, the application process has started: Not-required / Yes / No.<br/>
</p>

<p>
When preparing your camera-ready, please make sure that you omit all headers (no page numbers, no running title, no running
authors) but specify them in the .tex source, because Springer will
activate them in reformatting the proceedings. For Word users, add the
specifications without activating headers.
</p>

<p>Authors not following the instructions may result in the paper being excluded from the proceedings.</p>
